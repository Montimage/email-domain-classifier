I tried to implement the %^H approach, but I could work out how to set/get %^H
in C code in way that actually achieved the right effect.

I tried implementing the warnings approach by having C (and above)
do C ;
in the same way that C does C
but I got a test failure in t/op/reg_namedcapture.t

I attach the guts of the later patch, in case someone can work out what is wrong.
The simplest failure is 
% env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=1 ./perl -Ilib -e 'keys %!'
Assertion he->shared_he_he.hent_hek == hek failed: file ""hv.c"", line 2257 during global destruction.

Any suggestions welcome.

January 13, 2008: Don't just stand there, think - New research suggests that we think not just with our brains, but with our bodies. By Drake Bennett. The Boston Globe. ""The brain is often envisioned as something like a computer, and the body as its all-purpose tool. But a growing body of new research suggests that something more collaborative is going on - that we think not just with our brains, but with our bodies. ... The term most often used to describe this new model of mind is 'embodied cognition,' and its champions believe it will open up entire new avenues for understanding - and enhancing - the abilities of the human mind. ... The greatest impact, however, has been in the field of neuroscience itself, where embodied cognition threatens age-old distinctions - not only between brain and body, but between perceiving and thinking, thinking and acting, even between reason and instinct - on which the traditional idea of the mind has been built. ... 'If you want to teach a 
computer to play chess, or if you want to design a search engine, the old model is OK,' says Rolf Pfeifer, director of the artificial intelligence lab at the University of Zurich, 'but if you're interested in understanding real intelligence, you have to deal with the body.' Embodied cognition upends several centuries of thinking about thinking. Rene Descartes, living in an age when steam engines were novelty items, envisioned the brain as a pump that moved 'animating fluid' through the body - head-shrinkers through the ages have tended to enlist the high-tech of their day to describe the human cognitive system - but the mind, Descartes argued, was something else entirely, an incorporeal entity that interacted with the body through the pineal gland. ... After the development of the modern computer in the years after World War II, a new version of the same model was adopted, with the brain as a computer and the mind as the software that ran on it. In the 1980s, however, a grou!
 p of scholars began to contest this approach. Fueled in part by broad disappointment with artificial-intelligence research, they argued that human beings don't really process information the way computers do, by manipulating abstract symbols using formal rules.""

January 14, 2008: Big Brother Really Is Watching - Homeland Security is bankrolling futuristic profiling technology to nab terrorists before they strike. By Robert L. Mitchell. Computerworld. ""As soon as you walk into the airport, the machines are watching. Are you a tourist -- or a terrorist posing as one? As you answer a few questions at the security checkpoint, the systems begin sizing you up. An array of sensors -- video, audio, laser, infrared -- feeds a stream of real-time data about you to a computer that uses specially developed algorithms to spot suspicious people. The system interprets your gestures and facial expressions, analyzes your voice and virtually probes your body to determine your temperature, heart rate, respiration rate and other physiological characteristics -- all in an effort to determine whether you are trying to deceive. Fail the test, and you'll be pulled aside for a more aggressive interrogation and searches. That scenario may sound like science f
iction, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is deadly serous about making it a reality. ... Assuming that the system gets off the ground, Project Hostile Intent also faces challenges from privacy advocates.""

January 17, 2008: AI news reader brings academia to the real world. iTnews Australia. ""When he found himself staring at a screenful of irrelevant headlines in search of the few news stories of interest, Artificial Intelligence enthusiast Alex North decided that it was time to delegate the task to a machine. Thus was born tiinker, which was launched this week by North's start-up company, Deep Grey Labs, as an intelligent news aggregator that learns the interests of individual users and selects stories tailored to each individual. ... For the past year, tiinker has been a full-time venture for Sushkov and North, who are both recent graduates of the school of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales. The intelligent news aggregator was one of three ideas that the pair thought up, with the aim of applying their academic knowledge in a real world product. 'There are a number of machine learning and AI [Artificial Intelligence] techniques in the backend
, tuned and combined in a way we believe to be unique,' North said. 'Our studies in AI at uni were a good preparation for developing this - we knew what to try first and how to make it work well.'""
[*]Also see: Reuters Wants The World To Be Tagged. By Alex Iskold. ReadWriteWeb (February 6, 2008). ""[L]ast week Reuters - an international business and financial news giant - launched an API [Application Programming Interface] called Open Calais. ... The idea behind Calais is simple - identify interesting bits into metadata in documents. In this implementation the focus is on People, Companies, Places, and Events, but surely the technology can be adopted to other entities. The heavy lifting is done by the combination of a natural language processing engine and a massive hard coded, learning database that Clear Forest has built. ... What is Calais Good For?There are quite a few interesting applications for this technology. First - better search. Knowing the kinds of entities in the text allows developers to build intelligent search engines that look for related content. ...""\\n

January 18, 2008: EC eases translation process. By Chris Galea. DI-VE. ""As part of its efforts to foster multilingualism, the European Commission has published a collection of about 1 million sentences and their translations in 22 of the 23 official languages of the EU, including Maltese. ... This kind of data is highly sought after by developers of machine translation systems in which automatic translation software 'learns' from manually translated texts how words and phrases are correctly and contextually translated. The data can also help the development of other linguistic software tools such as grammar and spell checkers, online dictionaries and multilingual text classification systems. Such tools are also being researched and developed in Malta thanks to a concerted effort between the University of Malta's Department of Artificial Intelligence and the Institute of Linguistics.""

They look similar to Post-It notes but combine artificial intelligence, natural language processing, ink recognition technologies, and radio frequency identification tags into a modern version of the reliable analog. ...

January 22, 2008: Life after Google, with millions. By Stefanie Olsen. CNET News.com. ""What would you do if you were flush with $10 million or $100 million? Would you retire, go to work every day at the company that made you rich, or chase other dreams? That's the multimillion-dollar question for hundreds of early Googlers ... Georges Harik, one of Google's first 10 engineers, former director of new products, now investor and founder of a nonprofit artificial intelligence lab ... Like some of his peers, Harik is investing in small companies.... Harkening back to his college studies of mathematical models of genetic algorithms, he's also opening a yet-to-be-named research lab in Palo Alto to develop artificial-intelligence software for the fields of biotech and medicine. He plans to invest about $100,000 in the lab this year. 'The largest intelligence system at Google is in AdSense and the Gmail spam system, but I've always really wanted to see our work applied to medicine and
 biology, which is sort of hard to do at a company,' said Harik, adding that the software will be open-source with access to the entire medical community. The nonprofit is partially funded by Google, Harik said. ... Scott Hassan, early Google architect, now robotics advocate ... [T]he mission is to make Willow Garage a hub for robotics development in the areas of personal assistants, autonomous boats, and driverless cars--with the hopes of attracting talent and partnerships across the country. The company is collaborating with Stanford in the robotics field, having donated $850,000 to its computer science lab. With Hassan's fortune, Willow Garage has plenty of time to develop new markets for robots.""

""In the sea of blokey middle-aged males who typically dominate the ranks of Australian technology companies, a small group of enterprising women have built multi-million dollar IT businesses - and they're hell bent on turning the gender tides. ... [Liesl] Capper, who built and sold a multi-national education franchise before starting her first technology company, said women should break free of their traditional stomping grounds - education, health, cosmetics and fashion - and give the IT industry a chance. She is now CEO of MyCybertwin, a startup allowing individuals and businesses to create artificial intelligence online identities capable of talking to clients on their behalf. Companies including publishing house Consolidated Media Holdings, formerly known as PBL, are adopting the technology as a cheaper way to provide 24/7 live customer support via their websites. ... Accord
ing to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only 1 per cent of total employed women in the population work in the Information & Communications Technology (ICT) industry. But [Danielle] Lehrer said she had noticed more and more women entering the industry and studying computer sciences, which she said was changing the perception of what working in IT is like.""

By Tom A. Peter. The Christian Science Monitor. ""The battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan are likely to provide the first test for a potential breakthrough in robotics: the ability to 'see' well enough and quickly enough to move through unknown terrain without human help. The US military plans to use the technology – three-dimensional flash laser radar (LADAR) – to remove bombs and search for casualties in chemically contaminated areas without giving up human control. Eventually, however, self-navigating LADAR could show up on Hollywood movie sets to enable special effects – or in your car to prevent collisions with pedestrians. ...

January 26, 2008: Sports, technology and the meaning of 'human' - The 'future' depicted in science fiction is upon us now: Should we improve ourselves to the point of being 'post-human'? By Peter McKnight. The Vancouver Sun. ""Indeed, the emergence of enhancement technologies -- including, but not limited to nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science, referred to collectively as NBIC -- raises questions about the extent to which we should employ science to improve the human condition. To be sure, we have always used technology to allow us to live longer and better lives, but with the rapid progress of science, it's possible that we will soon develop technologies that allow us, not just to run faster or see farther, but to change our very physical and psychological essence -- to become, as it were, 'post-human.' ... Indeed, a brief look at the annals of science fiction reveals the intense concern with the consequences of trans-humanism, from the
 development of intelligent machines that could wipe out humanity (the Terminator movies series), to the creation of a multi-tiered society, with genetically enhanced 'humans' at the top (Gattaca), or with genetically engineered 'humans' at the bottom (Blade Runner).

January 27, 2008: The Coming Wave of Gadgets That Listen and Obey. By Michael Fitzgerald. The New York Times. ""Innovation usually needs time to steep. Time to turn the idea into something tangible, time to get it to market, time for people to decide they accept it. Speech recognition technology has steeped for a long time: Mike Phillips remembers that in the 1980s, when he was a Carnegie Mellon graduate student trying to develop rudimentary speech recognition systems, 'it seemed almost impossible.' Now, devices that incorporate speech recognition are starting to hit the mass market, thanks to entrepreneurs like Mr. Phillips. ... Over all, speech recognition was a $1.6 billion market in 2007, according to Opus Research, which predicts an annual growth rate of 14.5 percent over the next three years. ... James R. Glass, a principal research scientist at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at M.I.T., says speech technology 'is going to end up everywhere sp

January 30, 2008: Could AI speed VA claims? By Rick Maze. Army Times. ""A House subcommittee that is considering the use of artificial intelligence to speed the processing of veterans’ disability claims heard compelling evidence Tuesday about the problems facing veterans and their families trying to receive earned benefits. ... Kim Graves, VA’s director of the office of business process integration, said the department 'has made significant strides in the use of information technology to improve claims processing in all of our benefit programs.'... [Rep. John Hall of New York] and [Rep. Doug Lamborn of Colorado], however, are talking about an even more sophisticated system in which computers would read key elements of a claim and determine whether VA should approve it. Hall said this is not exotic; artificial intelligence is already being used in banking and medicine to make or assist with decisions.""

Fredkin Professor and Chair Machine Learning Department School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University and Past-President of AAAI] that was presented at the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs hearing: The Use of Artificial Intelligence to Improve the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA’s) Claims Processing System (January 29, 2008).\\n

     [*]VA urged to use advanced technology to cut backlog of benefit claims. By Bob Brewin. GovernmentExecutive.com (January 30, 2008). ""Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence could help the Veterans Affairs Department reduce a backlog of disability claims that has spiked past 1 million, according to computer experts and veterans advocates. ... Training an employee to rate VBA claims can take two to three years and many leave within five years, [Rep. John Hall] said. Experienced raters can adjudicate only about three claims a day, spending two to three hours on each claim. He said the VA should consider the use of artificial intelligence technologies, such as automated decision-support tools that can determine disability payments, which would speed up claims processing. Computer experts who testified at the hearing said technology exists today that can automate the claims process and eliminate the backlog. 'If we can develop computer software such as TurboTax,
 which guides taxpayers as they fill out complex tax forms online, and which then provides them with instant, computer-based application of complex tax regulations to calculate to the penny the taxes they owe, then I see no reason why we cannot develop similar software to automate online filing of VA benefits claims and to automate a substantial fraction of the processing of these claims,' said Tom Mitchell, chairman of the Machine Learning Department at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Mitchell said the VBA needs to emulate health insurers such as Highmark Inc., a Pittsburgh-based company that uses computers to process 90 percent of its claims.""\\n
     [*] Automation could speed VA claims. By Rick Maze. Navy Times (February 5, 2008). ""Artificial intelligence -- already used to process private-sector insurance claims, handle banking transactions and double-check medical procedures -- might be the solution to help veterans get their benefits faster. Advocates do not envision technology completely replacing humans in deciding complicated disability benefits claims, but a computerized system could look at key elements of claims and at least make a preliminary recommendation about whether to approve or deny them. ... Tom Mitchell, a computer science professor at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Mellon University, said veterans benefits are exactly the type of records that artificial intelligence can help manage. 'Claims processing at the Veterans Benefits Administration appears to be amenable to a variety of improvements through the introduction of more computerized operations, including the adoption of artificial intelligence t
echnologies for rule-based processing, case-based reasoning and data mining,' Mitchell said. Commercial insurance claims are routinely processed online and automatically, Mitchell noted. One health insurance company 'processes over 90 percent of its insurance claims for hospital and physician services automatically, with no human intervention,' he said. ... 'I envision a VA in which a veteran can apply online for benefits, upload records, exams and other certificates, which are prioritized and classified by an expert system that can match the data to the rating schedule criteria and shorten the time it takes to generate a claim,' [subcommittee chairman, Rep. John Hall, D-N.Y] said, adding that a system could pick out key words to calculate a disability rating.""\\n
