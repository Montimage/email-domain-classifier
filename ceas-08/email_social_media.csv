The only way I have ever gotten the nvidia drivers to not hang (using swsusp, tuxonice, uswsusp, whatever) is to use suspend-to-ram after disabling whatever magic video card hackery the distro tries (on the theory that the nvidia binary driver knows more about the quirks my card has than the sleep scripts the distro uses). > Michael > > > _______________________________________________ > TuxOnIce-users mailing list > enpsfhxz-stvnz@lists.tuxonice.net > http://lists.tuxonice.net/mailman/listinfo/tuxonice-users > ------------------------------ >From nlnpr@nigel.suspend2.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 08:10:19 +1100 From: Nigel Cunningham  Subject: Re: [TuxOnIce-users] [TuxOnIce-devel] 3.0-rc5 released.

Alternatively, you can just set the  default console level higher than 1, or change it while hibernation is  running. This assumes that you have PM_DEBUG enabled.

As input I take data from a relational database. Below is a sample from this table stored in a MySQL database. Each row represents an ""EVENT"": ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1    t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3    t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_10  t3 : j    USER_1   EVENT_1     t_i j+1  USER_2   EVENT_4   t_i+1 : N    USER_A   EVENT_3   t_z ID: unique for each row. USER_X: USER with X an element from the set [0 .. A) identifying a user. EVENT_Y: EVENT with Y an element from the set [0 .. B) identifying an event. Conneting to the database works fine. Now, I would like to obtain the following format: A ""User-based B-dimensional vector/dictionary"" of all events where each position in this vector space corresponds to an event and holds a binary value - 0 or 1 - indicating whether the event occured or not. So duplicates are neglected. For the sample table below with B =3D 7 (indicating that there a 7 different events, numbered 0 through 6), this might look like: ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1   t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3   t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_4   t3 4    USER_1   EVENT_6   t4 5    USER_2   EVENT_5   t5 USER_1: (0,1,0,1,1,0,1) USER_2: (0,0,0,0,0,1,0) I hope that someone can help me out.

There are lots of great books available, which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools, artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods, some of which are implemented in Weka. Here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights: 1. To start with, Whitten & Frank's book on Data Mining is a great one. This is the book Weka refers to. There are also ones by Han; D. Hand on the same topic and widely used. 2. For Artificial Intelligence, Russel and Norvig; or Winston; or Knight or Charniak are widely read authors. In addition to all the books, there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides, papers, articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy. MIT has a great open source tutorial, most good Universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read. Hope this should help, Regards, Subrat ________________________________ From: mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz [mailto:mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz] On Behalf Of Andhra Loyola College Sent: Thursday, February 07, 2008 12:13 PM To: iuxxdkqk@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz Subject: [Wekalist] where can i find algorithms explanation dear weka forum,                         I had gone through all the documentations present in source forge, but i could not find clear explanation of the algorithms.Can some one tell me where i can find them in Internet. thank u. sunanda ________________________________ Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

Message-ID: <1202445584.28437.4.camel@poelzd-desktop> Content-Type: text/plain Hi  I am trying to classify a data set with 3 classes with the Multilayerperceptron algorithm using the Weka data mining programm. I am testing various parameter settings to see which one yields the best results. I am experimenting with various learning rates, momentums and delay on/off. So far most of the parameter combinations yielded good results of around 85% correctly classified instances. But every once in a while I find a combination of parameters where the classification doesnt work at all and one (sometimes even two) class(es) seems to be left out of the process and the confusion matrix looks like the following:     a    b    c   <-- classified as     0 6838    4 |    a = '(-inf-0.25]'     0 6728   72 |    b = '(0.25-0.75]'     0 2141 4952 |    c = '(0.75-inf)' I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this.  What can be the reason for such behaviour?

I would let a lap DS surgeon get 50 procedures under his belt before I would put myself at his mercy. Let someone else be the trial dummies. Get someone experienced.

(I spoke with a lady who had a consult with him who was set on the DS - he did a pretty aggressive sell on distal RNY to her.  She ended up choosing a different surgeon.)  That's been quite some time ago now, though. The list at www.duodenalswitch.com   is the list of surgeons I would consider sound.  There are a lot of surgeons who will put themselves out there as doing the DS or having been trained in it - when they truly are not pro-DS at all.  OH's list is notorious for those types of listings.  I know they tried to clean the list up a bit about a year ago or so, but it's still concerning to me that so many people get fed a TON of misinformation about the DS when they contact some of those listed there! Maybe it would be a good idea to call their office and ask some pointed questions: 1.	Does the doctor offer the DS as a surgical procedure? 2.	If so, how many DS surgeries has he done (total)? 3.	How many open?  How many lap? 4.	How many Lap DS surgeries has he done in the past year? 5.	How many surgeries that started out Lap were converted to open? 6.	What type of post-op follow-up does he have for DS post-ops? 7.	How many of his DS post-ops are willing to speak to prospective patients? 8.	Can he share information about his feelings about surgical specs? (I.e., what size gastric sleeve does he leave?  What length alimentary limb? What length common channel?) Just to name a few.

It's my understanding that he's not working with Dr. Oh any longer. He had done more than a few DS when he was practicing in California and I had heard he was not opposed to the DS, and had wondered why so few folks in Washington were interested in the DS. I think he's done more DS, sure not certain about the lap numbers, though. Washington could sure use a good DS surgeon that was regularly performing the DS, that's for sure!

Once you know that it  may be possible to decode the pattern to discover what is being found in  your logwatch mail. It may also be possible to instruct your system to  not scan mail from logwatch. dp ------------------------------ >From buddgrbonu@gmail.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:38 2008 Message: 5 Date: Thu, 07 Feb 2008 16:20:40 +0200 From: T?r?k Edwin  Subject: Re: [Clamav-users] Clamdscan not find viruses To: ClamAV users ML  Message-ID: <47AB13B8.1020406@gmail.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 Rick Macdougall wrote: > Hi, > > I have another example where clamdscan fails to find a virus but  > clamscan does. > > > I have a copy of the message in question if one of the devs would like a  > copy. > >    Please open a bugreport, and attach the sample (marked as private).

PhishingScanURLs was no (hard coded), changing it to yes  makes clamdscan see it. How ever the reason I saw it was because a message came in on mail  server 3 last night and was not caught, but the message was then  forwarded to a user on mail server 2 where it was rejected by clamdscan. Now, mail server 2 did not see the virus this morning when I checked it  again but it obviously did last night when PhishingScanURLs = no. Any reason for that that you can see ?

Join us February 20, 2008, at 12 noon Eastern Standard Time (9am PST, 5pm GMT)
for a new webinar discussing miRNAs and Cancer.  The role of miRNAs in human
disease, including cancer, is now well established.  Many questions remain
however, such as precisely how miRNAs exert their effects, whether they make
suitable biomarkers, and how they could be applied therapeutically.  Join our
three expert panelists as they discuss current research on miRNAs important in
tumorigenesis, as well as techniques for miRNA discovery and profiling.
Time is running out!  Register today:  www.sciencemag.org/webinar

- - - - - miRNAs and Cancer Webinar brought to you by Science - - - - - 
Join us February 20, 2008, at 12 noon Eastern Standard Time (9am PST, 5pm GMT)
for a new webinar discussing miRNAs and Cancer.  The role of miRNAs in human
disease, including cancer, is now well established.  Many questions remain
however, such as precisely how miRNAs exert their effects, whether they make
suitable biomarkers, and how they could be applied therapeutically.  Join our
three expert panelists as they discuss current research on miRNAs important in
tumorigenesis, as well as techniques for miRNA discovery and profiling.
Time is running out!  Register today:  www.sciencemag.org/webinar 
Produced by the AAAS/Science Business Office and sponsored by Stratagene,
an Agilent Technologies company.

Hi.  Most likely this is a case of overfitting (overtraining):  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting): ""especially in cases where  learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare, the  learner may adjust to very specific random features of the training data,  that have no causal relation to the target function.""  Overfitting in back-propagation neural networks like MLP (resulting in  prediction bias toward one/some of the target classes) can be caused by the  following: if misclassified training instances continue to be misclassified  iteration after iteration, they get overweighted and actually take weight  from the correctly classified instances, i.e. the weights become  imbalanced. Furthermore, if misclassified instances happen to be clearly  concentrated to some classes, this can result in confusion matrix that you  quoted (zero correct instances for some classes).  > I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this.  MLP describes the parameters as follows: ""learningRate -- The amount the  weights are updated. momentum -- Momentum applied to the weights during  updating. decay -- This will cause the learning rate to decrease. This will  divide the starting learning rate by the epoch number, to determine what  the current learning rate should be. This may help to stop the network from  diverging from the target output, as well as improve general performance.""  As far as I know, no off-the-shelf formula exists for optimizing these  parameters. It is an interchange of parameters and the dataset. If you are  looking for a pattern in performance, consider that the parameters operate  together (learning rate * momentum / decay) so that the first two operate  for controlling speed of change and the latter for stopping the change.  ""Ultimately, the cost function will depend on the task we wish to perform.""  (wiki). If you are getting as high as > 85% accuracies from most  configurations, this suggests that optimal training model for this dataset  is produced when the parameters are set on 'fast burn' (few iterations) so  I would say higher learning rate * momentum and fast decay work best (do  they?).

I am using squirrelmail 1.4.13 with Dovecote and postfix on ubuntu 6.10.
Is there a way to have the autorespond plugin send a vacation message every
time an email is received from the same email address instead of just the
first time a message is sent.
Regards, Kenneth.

Summary: imap-tte

Initial Comment:
A patch that enables train-to-exhaustion support for IMAP.

This patch has three parts:

1. an __init__.py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to tte.py.  This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.

2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py

3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.

This is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.

I'm a little curious about the -C flag.  The code reads:

         elif opt in (""-c"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = arg
         elif opt in (""-C"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = ''
In general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in tte.py quite a bit. 
Thanks for that...  A couple comments:

* The ""--cullext"" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have
""--cull"" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. 
Let me know if you have a different change in mind.

* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in
case he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.  Tony, just mark it
closed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take
issue with.

* You're using psycopg classifier?  Brave man. ;-)

Great!  Please give the code a once-over before checking it in.  It
touches quite a few parts of SpamBayes and I don't want to step on any
toes.

I applied it to my environment.  tte.py and my strange
fetchmail/sb_bnfilter.py setup seems to work fine.

    contrib/tte.py 1.18
    spambayes/mboxutils.py 1.11
    spambayes/storage.py 1.63
    scripts/sb_imapfilter.py 1.67

I would like you to try it out a little, at least, before feeling
confident about it.  I've only used it on IMAP folders and I wouldn't want
to break the other use cases.

Dave,

Do you think this has stabilized well enough to apply to the
repository?  If so, I'll just make a quick review and apply
it.

That patch evolved yet again, massively.  I implemented a version of
culling for IMAP and refactored tte.py to greatly simplify it and remove
redundancy.  Hope you find that nice and not annoying ;-)

It looks like I forgot one thing in sb_imapfilter.py:

             imap_filter = IMAPFilter(classifier, message_db)
 
         httpServer = UserInterfaceServer(options[""html_ui"", ""port""])

I've attached a complete patch that contains that change and all of my
other fixes/workarounds (I have several patches in this tracker that
haven't been acted on).  You can ignore it if you prefer and just make the
additional change above.

It may well be that we  didn't get the wording right yet. First, a confession: most of the major changes in -02 are my doing.  In particular, I think I pushed some things onto Jim that went  further than he had wanted.  I think it's unfair to ask Jim to defend  things that are basically my own responsibility.  I particularly  apologize because I went in for major surgery just about the time  this was hitting the fan, and I'm not yet fully functioning. There's a certain philosophical difference between folks on this  list.  Some want SSP to be extremely specific.  Others have gone on  at length that the SSP spec has no right or authority to impose its  own will on receivers.  I have sympathies for both positions, but I  have to agree that there is no chance that we can successfully  dictate how receivers operate.  I've said publicly many times that  receivers will simply ignore the specs if it makes their lives better  --- as we see today with intentional violations of RFC 2822.  SSP-02  is an attempt to pare SSP down to appeal to the second set.  Yes,  that weakens SSP, but that seems inevitable at this point.  In  particular, I'm concerned that without giving receivers any guidance  on how certain situations should be handled we'll end up in a fairly  chaotic state.  However, I do agree that such guidance should  probably go in a non-standards-track document. A few specific points from your message: --On February 6, 2008 1:46:58 AM -0500 Hector Santos   wrote: [...] > With SSP-02/ASP, we lost the powerful SSP-01 DKIM=ALL protection > against 3rd party fraud. Speaking about SSP-02, I'm not sure how you see we've lost that  ""protection"".  In -01, DKIM=ALL specifically allowed 3PS (Third-Party  Signatures), so arguably it was weaker before.  Under SSP-02, a  receiver could decide that 3PS should be treated more harshly (where  ""more harshly"" doesn't necessarily mean ""discard"" --- it could just  mean do content scanning on the message). We did remove all discussion of 3PS.  The extended list discussion  around them made it clear that we just don't have enough operational  knowledge at this time to understand how they should work.  As such,  we are now leaving all interpretation of 3rd party signatures up to  the receiver.  That doesn't mean we've necessarily lost the ability  to handle 3PS in a distinct way, but it will have to go into another  document, at least for now. > The NEVER concept can still be covered using DKIM=DISCARDABLE and a > NULL DKIM public key. > > The EXCLUSIVE concept can still be covered using DKIM=DISCARDABLE. Except that DISCARDABLE doesn't prohibit 3PS.  It doesn't even say  that messages without any signatures MUST or even SHOULD be  discarded.

It doesn't even mention first parties, any more than it mentions 3rd  parties.  All it says is ""when the message left my control, I had  signed it.""  It says absolutely nothing about how the receiver should  handle the message. Similarly, and as noted above, DKIM=DISCARDABLE makes no normative  assertions about what the receiver should do with the message.  It is  impossible to say anything about when the receiver should reject  messages without stepping into the forbidden territory of forcing a  certain behavior on the receiver. > In short, DKIM=ALL is the SPF version of SOFTFAIL where you can > record it, but you do not take any REJECTION action on it.

I'm not speaking to ASP, but SSP-02 makes (or is intended to make) NO  normative restrictions on when the receiver should accept or reject  any messages. Another addition to SSP-02 was the concept of the Evaluator.  This  was added purely to try to make it clear that SSP is merely one input  into the decision process.  The Evaluator decides whether to reject a  message, quarantine it, do additional content scanning on it, accept  it without further scanning, redirect it to the FBI, post it on  USENET, or anything else it cares to do.  My hope was that creating  an explicit entity that makes the decision and clearly declare it out  of scope we would clarify the limits of SSP. It is my sincere hope that we will quickly gain enough experience  that new documents can be produced providing further guidance (not  requirements) for how the Evaluator should interpret SSP for broadest  interoperability. eric ------------------------------ >From mwbfbfl@santronics.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 2 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 06:28:05 -0500 From: Hector Santos  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02.txt ASP/SSP section 	2.8 To: Eric Allman  Cc: DKIM List  Message-ID: <47AC3CC5.3000407@santronics.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed Eric, I sincerely appreciate your response and I do hope you are on your way  to full recovery from your surgery. I had a hip replacement a few years  back and it was the first time in a long time I was forced into a  prolonged 'vacation' from work. :-) It been a long road to where we are now.  A road where we tuned nearly  every stone and discussed, and even worked out.  There were some  remaining issues, but ones that I don't believe were not addressable. The best I can describe the concerns is that we lost the potential for  protocol consistency fraud. For example, you pointed out SSP-01 DKIM=ALL offered 3rd party  signatures and this could be deemed weaker,  I agree with that point. However, I never indicated that a VALID 3rd party was ever classified as  secured, but the lack of one is were the power of the concept is found. The concept is really nothing new compare to other fraud detection  concepts, things we all do in some form or another, include SMTP. A simple example is a traffic cop requesting and analyzing your driver  license.  The officer is first going to make sure that the attributes  indicated on the card matches what he sees in person. If the driver is a  20 year old woman and the license says 60 year old man, then this among  other thing he can compare raises a red flag. Anything that doesn't conform to expectations is always the first thing  people notice.  As you know, this is a basic model in lots of things we do. In our SMTP world, an excellent example is PORT 25 and its relaxed SMTP  compliance versus PORT 587 and its strict SMTP compliance requirements.    i.e, EHLO checking under port 25 is recognized as low benefit for many  historical reasons.  Under port 587, EHLO correctness is a requirement.    Same with other expects between the two protocols.   In short, PORT  587 has less tolerance towards legacy operations - by design.  You must  login.  You must have certain headers, etc. Even in standard SMTP port 25 operations, we have basic x822 header  requirements that some systems may be very strict about if they don't  exist in the DATA block or post SMTP processing. But there is no BCP for  this. But with DKIM/SSP we can take control of this now and not allow it to  become yet another ""relaxed"" protocol. So again, the power here is in protocol inconsistency fraud detection.  Once things are all ""compliant"" then the other things comes into play,  because there is really not much more DKIM/SSP can do from this point. This is where other layers may come into play, including reputation  ideas and anything else.  I never argued against reputation. I just felt  that one group was trying to based DKIM/SSP on it only and not even  given the SSP concept a chance.  Unfortunately, the entire process has  been commandeered in what appears to be a strategic goal to simply water  it down to a level of total uselessness. So to me the idea of an Evaluator would be first a fundamental protocol  consistency Evaluator that would be part of the DKIM/SSP framework  across all supportive/compliant systems.  It would be 100% independent  from any subjective or heuristics or reputation analysis or any one  group detecting their questionable inherent policies or implementations  methods. It really has nothing to do with good guys vs bad guys because as we  know, bad guys too can exhibit compliant behavior.  But that is we want  here - we want to make sure everyone (bad and good) are all playing in  the same field of following the basic fundamental protocol.  Just like  we expect with other any standard client/server communications protocol. We want this model because if we can't expect compliance with the GOOD,  than we can't expect it from the BAD, and if we allow DKIM/SSP to become  this, we would be back to square one of relaxed SMTP legacy transactions  where receivers lack enforcement and know hows but more importantly has  no new information to rely on beyond the normal level of operations to  consider. DKIM/SSP changes all that, this is what lead me to technology and I of  the belief this will be a major benefit for the SMTP industry. But this is only going to work with a standard protocol ""out of the box""  all must follow if they wish to implement it.  I think this is all  separate from having extra evaluators (i.e, reputations, spam-assassin,  etc).   If we start with standard relaxed higher level system, then we  will have lost an unique opportunity we haven't had in SMTP.

This changes ""strict"" (the exclusivity) assertion into   something that does not express a domain's intentions on exclusivity.    This assertion simply increases the likelihood of having the domain's   messages discarded. You have previously mentioned the motivation was to accommodate high   profile domains finding themselves victims of phishing attacks.  Using   the term ""discardable"" appears to be sending the wrong message.  It   seems unlikely these high profile domains want their messages silently   discarded, as this assertion implies.  Discarding of messages does   several things: - Destroys evidence of a serious crime - Reduces delivery integrity for important transactional messages - Makes resolving compatibility far more problematic Can you see changing this into terminology that does not attempt to   suggest a verifier action?  Going out on limb, I'll add a modified   furthermore statement.  (Frankly, this furthermore statement seems to   belong in a BCP that happens later.) Using Hector's term ""exclusive""- exclusive: All mail from the domain is signed with an intent to avoid agents that may damage or remove signatures.  Furthermore, in lieu of a trusted third-party signature, if a message arrives without a valid Author Signature due to modification in transit, submission via a path without access to a signing key, or other reason, the domain encourages the recipient(s) to reject the message or issue a DSN when the RFC 2821 MAILFROM domains match. -Doug ------------------------------ >From dupzyp@returnpath.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 4 Date: Fri, 8 Feb 2008 13:01:14 -0500 From: ""J D Falk""  Subject: RE: [ietf-dkim] draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02.txt ASP/SSP section 	2.8 To: ""DKIM List""  Message-ID: 	<8k3p2k4495405372skl3204q9f4g5d728klpg0@rpnyex01.rpcorp.local> Content-Type: text/plain;	charset=""us-ascii"" Eric wrote: > It is my sincere hope that we will quickly gain enough experience that > new documents can be produced providing further guidance (not > requirements) for how the Evaluator should interpret SSP for broadest > interoperability. +1 ------------------------------ >From jbtl+fzfg@sendmail.org  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 11:15:15 -0800 From: Eric Allman  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02.txt ASP/SSP section 	2.8 To: Hector Santos  Cc: DKIM List  Message-ID: <52069CA5ADAE4FDE65B4E124@rieux.neophilic.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed Hector, I have to admit that I'm having a bit of problem understanding  everything you are saying in your response, perhaps because I haven't  been able to get through the nearly 500 messages that came in while I  was recuperating.  I finally concluded that I had to just jump in,  but I am missing some context. Thanks for your example on SMTP vs SUBMIT --- that gives me a good  handle on what you mean by ""relaxed protocol"".  But I'm not  understanding ""protocol consistency fraud"".  I think they are  connected, but I don't understand how, and how SSP-02 makes it easier  vs. SSP-01. So far as I am aware, the SSP-02 /protocol/ is no weaker than in  SSP-01.  What is weaker normative requirements on how the receiver  interprets that protocol, which is inevitable if you buy into the  idea that SSP has no right to impose any requirements on the  receivers.  If you're disagreeing with that premise then I fully  understand; this is just a case where you have to choose one and go  with it, because you can't have it both ways.  As I said before, my  position is that as desirable as it may seem to put requirements on  the receiver in order to guarantee consistent results, the reality is  that the receivers will do whatever they want to in order to give the  best results for themselves and their customers.  Hence, saying ""no  normative requirements for receivers"" is in my mind just bowing to an  inevitable reality. This is at the root of eliminating the concept of 3rd Party  Signatures.  They were only relevant in terms of how the receiver  interprets the DKIM results, and hence inappropriate for discussion. You say some things about the Evaluator that lead me to believe that  you've got a different idea of what it should be than I do.  You say: > So to me the idea of an Evaluator would be first a fundamental > protocol consistency Evaluator that would be part of the DKIM/SSP > framework across all supportive/compliant systems.  It would be > 100% independent from any subjective or heuristics or reputation > analysis or any one group detecting their questionable inherent > policies or implementations methods. This is the inverse of the model in my head, where the Evaluator is  completely /dependent/ on ""subjective or heuristics or reputation  analysis"" --- it is, in short, how the receiver decides how to  process the message.  Indeed, the point of introducing the concept is  an attempt to make explicit what is out of scope for normative  definition in the SSP spec. If I'm misunderstanding what you are trying to say (very possible)  then I apologize and request further explanation. eric --On February 8, 2008 6:28:05 AM -0500 Hector Santos   wrote: > Eric, > > I sincerely appreciate your response and I do hope you are on your > way to full recovery from your surgery.

It's an assertion that the sender would prefer that the recipient not   deliver some small fraction of legitimate email as well as some small   fraction of illegitimate email, rather than delivering those small   fractions of legitimate and illegitimate email. In the senders opinion, it is more important that mail claiming to be   from them not be delivered than for it to be delivered. The english meaning of ""discardable"" matches the semantics pretty   well. If we want implementors to easily understand and deploy the   specification, and more importantly the limits of them doing so, thats   fairly important.

Yes. Sorry, I didn't post an update because I was embarrassed at my own
stupidity for not thinking it through more carefully before posting my
original message. Switching the jobs round did indeed mean that sa-learn
is no longer getting interfered with by archivemail while it's in
mid-learn. It now behaves quite sensibly.

Yes I understand that. It's not that I *keep* a temp folder of spam/ham, I
don't. I know that it only needs to learn the *new* mails. It's just that
I'm basically lazy, and it seemed far easier for me simply to take all
my non-spam folders and copy them together into one big temporary
file, run sa-learn on it and then delete the temporary file, eg:

#!/bin/bash
cat ~/mail/mailinglists/* ~/mail/WorkStuff/* ~/mail/Admin/* > TempHam
sa-learn --ham --mbox ~/mail/TempHam
rm ~/mail/TempHam

I'm no bash-scripting wiz (that much should be obvious!) so I could
think of no *easy* way to strip only today's mails out of my 20-odd
folders and just feed those to sa-learn. My way, I need to do nothing
myself, the job takes about half an hour, and I'm asleep when it
happens... OK, sa-learn has to work a bit harder than it needs to, but
hey, better it than me!

The 180 days thing is because I choose to keep only the last 6 months
(approx) mail in each of my 20 or so folders, the rest being zipped into a gzip
archive using ""Archivemail"" (a very neat little utility btw) and 180 days is
its default setting (see I told you I was lazy!).

Thanks for all the help and suggestions. Much appreciated...

That's not a question for the plugin.  The plugin merely sets the
responder on/off and with a message.  Your mail delivery system does
the actual autoresponding.  You need to know how to configure your
autoresponse system.  If you don't know how to do that, read up on
your mail system and ask in the right forum.  Also note that ""Local
User Autoresponder and Mail Forwarder"" will also work for you, but the
answer to your question will still be the same.

Summary: imap-tte

Initial Comment:
A patch that enables train-to-exhaustion support for IMAP.

This patch has three parts:

1. an __init__.py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to tte.py.  This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.

2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py

3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.

This is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.

I'm a little curious about the -C flag.  The code reads:

         elif opt in (""-c"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = arg
         elif opt in (""-C"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = ''
In general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in tte.py quite a bit. 
Thanks for that...  A couple comments:

* The ""--cullext"" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have
""--cull"" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. 
Let me know if you have a different change in mind.

* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in
case he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.  Tony, just mark it
closed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take
issue with.

* You're using psycopg classifier?  Brave man. ;-)

Great!  Please give the code a once-over before checking it in.  It
touches quite a few parts of SpamBayes and I don't want to step on any
toes.

I applied it to my environment.  tte.py and my strange
fetchmail/sb_bnfilter.py setup seems to work fine.

    contrib/tte.py 1.18
    spambayes/mboxutils.py 1.11
    spambayes/storage.py 1.63
    scripts/sb_imapfilter.py 1.67

I would like you to try it out a little, at least, before feeling
confident about it.  I've only used it on IMAP folders and I wouldn't want
to break the other use cases.

Dave,

Do you think this has stabilized well enough to apply to the
repository?  If so, I'll just make a quick review and apply
it.

That patch evolved yet again, massively.  I implemented a version of
culling for IMAP and refactored tte.py to greatly simplify it and remove
redundancy.  Hope you find that nice and not annoying ;-)

It looks like I forgot one thing in sb_imapfilter.py:

@@ -1200,6 +1209,7 @@
             imap_filter = IMAPFilter(classifier, message_db)
 
         httpServer = UserInterfaceServer(options[""html_ui"", ""port""])

         httpServer.register(IMAPUserInterface(classifier, imaps, pwds,

I've attached a complete patch that contains that change and all of my
other fixes/workarounds (I have several patches in this tracker that
haven't been acted on).  You can ignore it if you prefer and just make the
additional change above.

Nowhere have I said anything about not being able to create new users.

All the above quote is stating is, ""....bestows Administrative rights on 
*anyone* [my emphasis] who logs into the computer,...."".

What you write is, of course, all very exciting - except that for the 
Joe-in-the-street who buys a copy of the Home edition (AND Professional, 
BTW) will not have a damn clue that you need to use the OS as a user 
with NO Administrator privileges.

Which is why openSUSE was created.

Ciao.

I'm close enough to Gene's age and have known him long enough I get
the right to rap his knuckles. Hm, in about a year that advances a

Initial Comment:
A patch that enables train-to-exhaustion support for IMAP.

This patch has three parts:

1. an __init__.py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to tte.py.  This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.

2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py

3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.

This is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.

On --cullext vs --cull, I was thinking it could be '--cullext=' but if
getopt doesn't like that, I'm fine with --cull.

Since tony isn't very active, the thing got auto-closed.  But shouldn't
the patch be applied if he's not going to look at it?

I'm slowly working on moving suspend2.net/tuxonice.net to a new server based on Slicehost. (We've been abusing the kindness of the UWA computer club for too long). I've completed moving the wiki to the new server earlier in the afternoon - all going well, you shouldn't notice a difference yet. I'm looking to make some changes, though, to reduce issues with spam. At the moment I have some lines commented out that will limit editing so that a secure http connection is required. The other possibility is using captcha. I wouldn't mind any feedback people would like to give. In an hour or two, I plan on shifting email to the new server. This means that lists in particular will be down for at least part of the evening (Australian Eastern Standard Time). In the process, I'm going to rename the suspend2-* lists to tuxonice-*.

To: TuxOnIce-users  Message-ID: <47AD8023.5010905@nigel.suspend2.net> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""iso-8859-1"" Hi all. Here are test patches which should be of interest to this who've been having problems with the I/O speed. I'm providing patches for 2.6.23.15 and 2.6.24.1. The whole lowlevel I/O code has had quite a rework. In /sys/power/tuxonice/block_io, the only remaining entry is target_outstanding_io, which can be used to say how much memory you'd like to have made available for I/O. If more is available, it will be used too. There's one new entry in the /sys/power/tuxonice directory - no_flusher_thread. This entry is only useful if you've got multiple cpus/cores, and then only if no_multithreaded_io is 0 (ie multithreaded I/O is enabled). What I've done is this: by default, we now dedicate one thread (the CPU 0 one) to just submitting I/O. All other threads spend their time compressing pages and filling pages with the compressed data and associated metadata, then queueing filled pages for the submission thread to handle. If there's only one thread or no_flusher_thread is used, we go back to the old behaviour - threads compress, fill pages and submit them. So... options for multicore users: 1) Single threaded operation procsetting no_multithreaded_io 1 2) Multithreaded, flusher thread (default) procsetting no_multithreaded_io 0 procsetting no_flusher_thread 0 3) Multithreaded, no flusher thread procsetting no_multithreaded_io 0 procsetting no_flusher_thread 1 If you give the patches a try, would you please let me know how these different options perform?

Ouch, that would hurt my arthritic joints something terrible. Can it wait till 
I've had a chance to hit my thumbs with another cortisone shot?  On second 
thought, the iron bar is less painful in the short term.  The last time I 
checked, they wanted to do surgery at $5k per thumb and I said how about 
cortisone?  He said then (15 years ago) that it was $60 a shot, and it would 
hurt like hell.  He was right on both counts, but that thumb still works 
today.  Now its the other ones turn I guess.  :)

Summary: DEP / NX causes Outlook to crash

Initial Comment:
When enabling the NX function underneath WinXP with 
SP2 RC2 (32 bit edition, not 64 bit windows), I was 
unable to start Outlook with the SpamBayes plug-in.  
After disabling and only disabling NX (remove /noexecute 
from boot.ini), it worked.  

Funny thing is that the owner of the company I work for 
developed a Bayesian spam filter as well and it had the 
same issue with the NX.  Not sure what the problem is, 
but the NX feature would be nice to turn on.  Does 
anyone know if NX can be disabled at the application 
level so that the other processes were protected with 
NX?

The DEP /NX issue is not restricted to Athlon chips. I am using an Intel
Core 2 Duo processor. When DEP is enabled via software in the System dialog
in Windows XP MCE (probably also applies to Windows Vista), Outlook fails
to load the plugin.

The web page text needs to remove the processor limitation.

I've tried a few basic Python programs packaged with py2exe 0.6.5 and
Python 2.4 with hardware DEP enabled on Windows XP SP2 on a newer Pentium-M
(with XD support) and on Windows Server 2003 on an Athlon 64 (with NX
support). Everything seems to work fine. I tried all of py2exe's bundle
options and couldn't get Windows to complain. The Python scripts I used for
testing only do simple arithmetic and make use of EasyDialogs for Windows
(which uses ctypes).

Does that mean you predict that any py2exe program would
fail to run?  If so, I'm happy to put together a ""hello
world"" program and attach it so people can verify that this
is the case.

Just noting that the Pythonwin issue appears related to the
dde module and this is not used by spambayes.  I'm therefore
back to suspecting py2exe.

A lot of people are hitting this these days, so changing the
summary in the hope that people will notice this bug and not
submit new ones (it's already in the FAQ).

Just had a report that Pythonwin also fails with this turned
on.  This makes it less likely the problem is simply py2exe.

another possibility is that py2exe is the culprit.  It isn't
obvious to me that is *is* the problem, but it certainly is
possible.  It would be interesting to know if the source
version of SpamBayes has the same problem.  When I get back
to Aus, I will try and reproduce this.

This is a problem with NX protection...this is how I got it to 
work:

There are ways to disable NX at application level:
a) Through the UI...
i) ""Control Panel"" > ""System""
ii) Click on the ""Advanced"" tab
iii) Under ""Performance"" section, click ""Settings""
iv) Click on the ""Data Execution Prevention"" tab
v) Click ""Add"" and select the appication you want to disable 
NX for

b) Registry...
Under ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows 
NT\\CurrentVersion\\AppCompatFlags\\Layers"" (there are 
equivalent HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys), create a new string 
key, its name being the full path to the executable file you 
want to disable NX for, the value being ""DisableNXShowUI""

.you'll notice that in the UI, only executable files can be 
added. This means that I had to select the ""Outlook.exe"" file 
to get Spambayes to work again. I tried adding the 
spambayes_addin.dll and the python23.dll paths to the registry 
as a workaround, but this didn't work...

Also, if you are using Outlook 2003, you may need to re-enable 
the plug-in by deleting its resilliency key (the COM Add-in 
Manager won't remember the re-enable setting no matter how 
many times you try):

FYI, the same techniques work with Inboxer etc. I'm guessing, 
as tim_one said, it's to do with the Python libraries.

You'll really have to ask about NX gimmicks on an Athlon list.

SpamBayes is written entirely in the Python programming 
language, and that never, ever tries to execute code from a 
data region (I'm very familiar with Python's implementation)   
My only guess is that Outlook itself, or MAPI, try to do this 
when interfacing with extensions.  Or Mark Hammond is 
playing disgusting games (the only kind he knows, really 
) in the win32all Python extensions.

user7@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc,tdrf3946@crackmice.com,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 01:28:11 +0100",Re: there goes the neighbourhood ,"
is paraphernalia another Guard word, like vehicles?

(I just figured out why guards pronounce ""vehicle"" like ""veh hicle""
instead of ""vee hicle"", btw, it's because they have to fill out bilingual
forms all the time and the literal gaeilge translation is ""feithicil"".)

Worth noting this is leafy Grangegorman we're talking about here.
Glasnevin doesn't have this kind of behaviour, we just find Time Capsules.

Doh!  Please disregard the last two paragraphs. I was tracking down two issues
at the same time. The mentioned similarities about content, URI and Mailer don't

You've said this several times, but I don't think that's the range    of all possibilities. Ag.com is a pretty good example of somebody    that I as a receiver don't know but if they're willing to say    ""discard this if it's not signed"", all other things being equal    why wouldn't I?    In any case, this is pretty squarely into the secret sauce of    receiver filter logic, so I'm not sure what the point is about    needing agreement; filters are certainly allowed to be more    cautious which is how I read you.

You do what you want to do. I would hope that receivers don't discard mail simply because the domain owner says so. Instead, I would hope that their hint goes into a weighting process together with other indicators.

Because a noticeable chunk of what you'd be discarding would be legitimate mail that your users wanted. If an ISP pays more attention to what senders want than what their paying users want, they don't deserve to be in the business. The driving factor for receivers is delivering mail that their users want, and not delivering mail that their users object to. That is at direct odds to the design of SSP (which is to not deliver some small fraction of email both legitimate and otherwise). >  In any case, this is pretty squarely into the secret sauce of >  receiver filter logic, so I'm not sure what the point is about >  needing agreement; filters are certainly allowed to be more >  cautious which is how I read you.

Look, if you want to design your own products based on these heuristics,  thats fine, but don't tell us what or how we should implement technology    especially mandating via specs on methods that are without of doubt,  highly questionable, subjective and puts systems and domains at risk for  even greater abuse.

This seems to presuppose that the owner of the author domain doesn't    have any control over their own signing practices. If I publish    discardable, and it's broken or unsigned that's pretty much my    problem if it's legit.    And I'd like to understand where you get a ""noticeable"" chunk as    we've been running DKIM signing for almost 2 years now and even    with diverse mail use patterns of your average mega-corp we still    get 99%+ verification rates. And we most certainly do not fit the    bill for ""discardable"". For somebody who really fits the bill    for ""discardable"", I imagine that the false positives would be down    in the noise of the other reasons you get false positives. > The driving factor for receivers is delivering mail that their users > want, and not delivering mail that their users object to.    Sure. And a domain that tells me that I ought to consider tossing    something that isn't signed is dropping a pretty big hint that your    users are pretty likely to object to it. And if they're wrong, that's    their own problem to correct.

Not at all.  It means that the author domain has some control but not perfect control over its signing practices, and there will always be paths that break SSP, e.g., mail-an-article, roaming users sending through hotel MTAs, mailing lists, forwarders that replace Sender lines, we all know what they are. >   And I'd like to understand where you get a ""noticeable"" chunk as >   we've been running DKIM signing for almost 2 years now and even >   with diverse mail use patterns of your average mega-corp we still >   get 99%+ verification rates. I'm not sure how average a megacorp Cisco is.  I'll bet Cisco users send way less HTML mail that most other businesses, for example.  What do you do about lists like this one that mutate the headers in ways that break signatures?  I gather you may have some kludge to patch it up, but I don't think you can expect everyone else to do that. >   Sure. And a domain that tells me that I ought to consider tossing >   something that isn't signed is dropping a pretty big hint that your >   users are pretty likely to object to it. And if they're wrong, that's >   their own problem to correct. Look back at Steve's previous messages.  If the domain's bad advice makes the ISP drop mail its users want, the users will blame the ISP, not the SSP record.  This would make a reasonable ISP rather gunshy about believing the advice in random SSP records.   There are certainly heavily phished domains that merit discarding, but given what a small fraction of the total universe of mail they are, it's much more likely that most of the domains that publish SSP discardable will instead be due to admins who don't understand what it means.

SpamBayes CVS HEAD.  When I checked in the changes on HEAD I got a bunch of
messages like this:

    cvs diff: Tag 1.1 refers to a dead (removed) revision in file `core_server.py'.
    cvs diff: No comparison available.  Pass `-N' to `cvs diff'?

It looks like the checkin actually worked, but I've never seen that message
before.

This new application, scripts/core_server.py, is fundamentally the same as
the preexisting POP3 proxy, but uses a simple plugin scheme to support
different protocol adapters.  The only plugin written so far is spambayes/
XMLRPCPlugin.py, which, as you might guess, allows messages to be scored
using XML-RPC calls.  There are two methods, score and score_mime.  The
latter is pretty much what we are used to - essentially shoot an email (or
email-like) message over the pipe and get a score back.  The former method
(maybe it should be named score_form) accepts a dictionary representing a
form submission, a set of extra tokens generated by the client (such as was
the submission from an anonymous user?)  and a set of attachments.  The last
two args can be empty (though because of XML-RPC constraints they can't be
optional.)

The first application of this is likely to the the new Roundup-based Python
tracker.  I wrote a simple Roundup auditor for that purpose today.  I'll be
testing that over the next few days.  The second application will likely be
MoinMoin.  Marian Neagul is doing a Google Summer of Code project on page
classification which this might fit into nicely.  In theory, an web site can
use it though as long as it can speak XML-RPC.

BTW, before I merged I created a tag, BEFORE_CORESVR_MERGE.  I also created
an AFTER_CORESVR_MERGE tag after the big checkin.  Can people give the
existing applications a whirl to make sure I didn't break anything?

For Reimar and Marian (the MoinMoin gurus), I did a very little bit of
performance testing.  Roundtrip performance on my laptop (Mac PowerBook G4 -
800MHz) with both the server and client running on the same machine ranged
anywhere from 10-50 bytes/ms.  When I added a large payload (a MIME encoded
JPEG file of 9.5MB) performance in terms of bytes/ms shot way up, but as you
would imagine overall time did as well.  Here are some figures:

    attachment     time          bytes/ms
       size
    9587824        30.7 sec      312
     975978         3.7 sec      259
     114794         0.5 sec      252
      28675         0.2 sec      142

Thx,

Snowmail - Channel 4 News <bjhxttys_lhgwf@channel4.com>,undisclosed-recipients:;,"Wed, 06 Aug 2008 00:47:37 +0000",Cameron: 'You can get it if you really want',"Cameron: 'You can get it if you really want'
=========================================

The man who would be prime minister in a month or so if an electon is called, and if he wins, has spoken.

David Cameron carried off that public school accomplishment of speaking without hesitation, deviation or repetition - and without a script.

Remarkable enough in front of an audience reduced from Mrs Thatcher's 3,000 in Blackpool to 1,200. And he is unashamed to say how much he admires Eton, although he didn't name it - he just said it was a fantastic school.

He also revealed himself to be a Jimmy Cliff fan, one of the few areas of repetition involving the following famous phrase, 'You can get it if you really want.'

Cathy Newman is in Blackpool, savouring the aftermath of the Cameron speech and assessing whether he was wise to call on Mr Brown to have an immediate election - doesn't that make it harder to attack him for needlessly calling an election when he does?

We'll be assessing where we are regarding election campaigns, tensions, possibilities and more with Ken Clarke, Vince Cable and David Blunkett. Not just the �will he, won�t he?� debate, but the �should he, shouldn�t he?� - which is much more interesting.

Diana inquest latest
================

The Diana inquest rolls on and new footage and photos of the scene of her end are revealed.

Jane Dodge is down there, observing the coming and goings, not the least of which is Harrods owner muttering that the Royal Family murdered his son Dodi.

But it must be admitted he's done pretty well to get the inquiry even as far as this - even if in the end, as the judge put it, there was little doubt that the driver of the death car had indeed drunk alcohol.

Burma: new pictures
================

Talking of new video, there is new footage out of Burma and it's pretty horrid and pretty revealing. Jonathan Miller is looking at it and reporting on it from Bangkok.

Sex traffickers targeted
=====================

New figures reveal the horrific scale of the trafficking in women, particularly those from the erstwhile Eastern Block.

Once again, the spotlight fails to fall on the men who exploit them although police have today launched a new initiative to try to track the trafficking gangs.

Bye bye Blackpool
===============

Finally, we return to Blackppool to say goodbye.

Alas the other centres of population in Britain have so spruced up their conference capacity that Blackpool is falling by the wayside. And having lost the opportunity to sully its fine reputation with a giant casino, it is now losing the party conferences as well.

Nicholas Glass reports on one of the great political venues of our time.

Best wishes
Jon Snow

England. AISB conventions are organized by the largest AI society in the 
United Kingdom, SSAISB which stands for Society of the Study of 
Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour.

Norms are essential for artificial agents that are to display behaviour 
comparable to human intelligent behaviour or collaborate with humans, 
because the use of norms is the key of human social intelligence. Norms 
play a central role in many social phenomena such as coordination, 
cooperation, decision-making, etc. There is an increasing interest in 
the role of norms in societies, both inside as outside the agent 
community. Now the time is ripe for a symposium focussing on this 
central sociological concept given that the field of (multi)agent 
research is moving more and more from the individual, cognitive focussed 
agent models to models of socially situated agents. NorMAS therefore 
focuses on normative multiagent systems.

Normative multiagent systems combine theories and frameworks for 
normative systems with multiagent systems. Thus, these systems provide a 
promising model for human and artificial agent co-ordination, because 
they integrate norms and individual intelligence. They are a prime 
example of the use of sociological theories in multiagent systems, and 
therefore of the relation between agent theory and the social sciences, 
e.g., sociology, philosophy, economics, legal science, etc.

NorMAS2005, as part of AISB2005, will provide an excellent opportunity 
to meet researchers studying norms in cognitive science, social 
sciences, agent theory, computer science, philosophy, etc. to discuss 
the current state and identify potential future directions and research 
issues.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
The topics of this symposium include, but are not restricted to, the 
following issues:

a.. multiagent or society level:
  a.. balancing dynamics and statics at the agent (micro) and agent 
society (macro) level
  b.. coordination based on normative multiagent systems
  c.. emergence of conventions, norms, roles, and normative multiagent 
systems
  d.. combining conventions with regulative, permissive, constitutive 
and other types of norms
  e.. relation between NorMAS and contracts, security, and (electronic) 
institutions

b.. agent level:
  a.. alternatives to and extensions of the homo economicus and BDI logics
  b.. extending logical frameworks to encompass norms in agent decision 
making
  c.. how to implement theories of norms in artificial agents

c.. applications of NorMAS:
  a.. multiagent social simulation models containing norms
  b.. mixing artificial and human agents in hybrid social systems

I was so nervous before hand that I had to have my doc prescribe a sleeping pill for the last month prior to surgery! But I believe in God, and I believe He led me to find this surgery, so I just had to trust Him to know what was best for me!

Norine, Thank you and the others for your responses, it is wonderful to find a group like this where I can talk to others that have had the procedure. I have a surgery date of March 10th in Bowling Green, Ohio and up until this point I was looking forward to the beginning of a new me. I still am but I'm starting to get the jitters a little however I know that this is the best for me at this juncture of my life. Not to mention the added years that I'll be able to see my kids grow and their kids grow. I look forward to talking to everyone and I'm positive that you'll be seeing alot more of me both before and after surgery.

Hi, Mark I tend to think of myself as one of the lucky ones in terms of: Smell is *very* well controlled by daily acidophilus intake (its not as bad as it was pre-op!) Weight loss-Ive lost 95% of my excess body weight Food tolerance (untoasted bread, pasta and rice dont seem to set well in my tummy; other than that, I can and do eat almost anything and everything, with the exception of I never have carbonated beverages with my meals) I can apparently eat just about anything I want, and as long as I get enough protein, fluids, and my supplements every day, nothing seems to slow my weight loss. Keep in mind, with *all* of these factors in place, I am the *exception* to the rule. YMMV. I started taking the acidophilus because Ive always been very prone to yeast infections (even before the DS). I didnt realize that they were helping with gas odor until I *ran out* and lived without them for about a week! Ive never let *that* happen again! Lol. I take them religiously, twice a day. As far as recovery time, some people seem to experience a turning the corner experience at 4-5 weeks post-op (for open surgery; lap recovery time can be significantly less). It didnt work that way for me, however. Until about week 6, I pretty much felt like Id been run over by a truck. Then, very gradually, I began to feel more like myself. It was so gradual that I was probably at 10+ weeks when I realized hey, its been weeks since Ive felt like crap! lol.  For about two months, food did not taste good to me. No food tasted good. My surgeon assured me this would change, and it has. I love food again. Bread, rice and noodles make me feel just sort of yucky and dont appeal to me much. If I eat simple carbs with no fat/protein (like snow cones or cotton candy), my tummy gets upset. Everything else is a go. For the first few months (maybe 6 months?) I felt like I couldnt eat enough in one sitting. My meals were all one-course affairs because by the time I was done the protein I needed, I was too stuffed to eat any carbs! Now, Im very satisfied with the amount of food I can eat. I can probably eat about 8oz in a sitting. If its a longer meal, like a lunch date with a friend, I can eat a lot more than that. I bet over the course of two or three hours, I can polish off maybe 14oz or so of food. Ive lost 145lbs. As Ive said, I realize my experience isnt typical. But I *love* my DS, and would do it again in a heart beat! However, if youre really concerned about the smell factor, you may want to check into the VBG (vertical banded gastroplasty)-, which is just the stomach part of the DS. In other words, you get the restriction (you cant eat very much at one time), but none of the malabsorption or bowel issues that come with the re-working of the intestines. Best of luck!

I am 6 months post op and am doing well. I do have days with very smelly gas, and then other days when I have gas, but no smell.  When they smell, they are stinky - but honestly, I have noticed it mostly at night when I am home, so have not had any uncomfortable situations away from home...and let's face, other people's farts smell sometimes too!  The only other smell I have had to deal with has been stinky breath sometimes because of all the protein, but I just brush my teeth more often and use lifesavers more often, but otherwise, good there too. I am eating more ""normally"" now at 6 months, but still feel like there are times when I cannot eat as much, and still don't eat too many carbs, especially when not with protein.  I am feeling pretty good though and at 6 months have lost over 90 pounds.  My highest weight was 417, my surgery weight was 286, and I just weighed this morning at 293!  (I was so happy to break that ""300"" mark, as I don't remember the last time I was here!). I had the loss of taste for a few weeks and got really nervous about that, but it came back about 6 weeks post op, and now taste is totally back to normal and food is good again.   My recovery was good. I was out of work for 2 weeks totally, 1 week at 2-3 hours/day, and then full time from home the next 3 weeks, back in the office at 6 weeks.  The pain was gone in about a week and after that was pretty much just building up stamina and energy again. It was a good decision for me - I am off 3 out of 4 medications and probably going off the last one soon (yea!).  Taking the vitamins and drugs the surgeon prescribed has been fine for me - better than not going through this!! Best of luck to you!!

I felt like I couldnt eat enough in one sitting. My meals were all one-course affairs because by the time I was done the protein I needed, I was too stuffed to eat any carbs! Now, Im very satisfied with the amount of food I can eat. I can probably eat about 8oz in a sitting. If its a longer meal, like a lunch date with a friend, I can eat a lot more than that. I bet over the course of two or three hours, I can polish off maybe 14oz or so of food. Ive lost 145lbs. As Ive said, I realize my experience isnt typical. But I *love* my DS, and would do it again in a heart beat! However, if youre really concerned about the smell factor, you may want to check into the VBG (vertical banded gastroplasty), which is just the stomach part of the DS. In other words, you get the restriction (you cant eat very much at one time), but none of the malabsorption or bowel issues that come with the re-working of the intestines. Best of luck!

I knew what you meant and I chose to echo your concern.  I noticed that we got some support from a failed VBG and I am happy that came over.  Especially where we as men are concerned.  Our socialities, and thought processes are different I am told.  I am working with a close friend here as he tries to make the same decision.  He is not as proactive in his health as I might be.  He will choose what he shall, It will be the same to me, for he is my friend.  He is going to do something though, and I am proud of this giant step for him.  Yet, he is using man brain.

This is a neurologic condition and you should ask your GP for a referral to see a neurologist. I'm not saying this is reversible, but it could be a metabolic disorder, an anatomical disorder or something genetic or from an illness. I'll be praying for you, and best of luck to you!

Granted, having consistently low albumin levels *IS* threatening to your health, and MUST be dealt with.  Are you getting your labs done regularly?  Are you getting a FULL panel of labs done regularly?  (It's anywhere between 15 and 20 vials of blood when I go for a full panel of labs.)  Also, are you fasting 14 hours before your blood draw? Okay - about the brain thing.  I would *really* encourage you to find both a neurologist and a geriatric psychiatrist.  I know - you aren't a geriatric patient, but they have LOTS of experience with different (oftentimes age-related) forms of brain diseases.  Demand a cognitive assessment - it's a HUGE test, and it will likely take between 3 and 5 hours.  Also urge that they do MRI and Pet scan of your brain.  My Mom had Lewy Body Dementia and Frontal Temporal Lobe Dementia - if only we'd known to seek out the right kind of doctors IMMEDIATELY so much grief would have been spared! Sadly, there ARE forms of dementia or other brain diseases that strike people as early as their late teens (it's rare, but I've met families who have had it happen).  More and more younger folks are being struck with the earlier in life brain disorders/diseases.  I wish I could say there's no way it's possible.  But it is.  There are some GREAT resources online that provide amazing information and support.  Be sure to insist that they keep up and give you as close to a diagnosis as possible.  Sometimes they (doctors) get stumped (they are human, after all) and don't know what to do any more, so communication can lag.  Don't allow that.  You're going to have to be your own advocate.  Be certain that your husband accompanies you as often as possible to doctors visits.  He needs to understand what is going on and what he will need to support you. You will be in my thoughts and prayers!

If we comply eat, how we are suppose to, keep up with our labs, hopefully problems will be to a minimum, if any problems at all. your legs are swollen because of the low albumin.  Are you eating enough protein??? EVERY DAY???? You might think you are, but have you tried keeping track?  Protien always comes first.  are you taking all your supplements? I have never heard of a brian shrinking from weight loss surgery, you must ask the dr for more info or get a second opinion.  seek out a specialist. I am sorry for your problems.

My revision from the (useless) band to the DS was on March 10, 2005. I'm just about to be 3 years out. My recovery was uneventful for the most part - I didn't feel good with a return of energy until around 8 weeks. I think that 6 weeks was a turning point. I hope those are the right numbers, it's been so long ago it's hard to remember. As far as your other question goes, it's been almost 3 years and I think I went home early instead of going out with friends once due to feeling rather ""stinky"".  Otherwise, my bms and farts are stinky but not that bad. I teach students every day and I think in the past two years, they've mentioned a smell twice. They are first graders, for the most part, so believe me, tey are open with their opinions! I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's completely liveable and workable for me. The DS has been a miracle! I was at 440 pounds and heading to some serious mobility issues with 65% bodyfat and a BMI of 73.2. I wore a size 6x/7x and a size 40 pants (not waist size 40, size 40!) Now, at almost 3 years out, I am still slowly losing and I weigh 153 pounds with bodyfat of about 22% and a bmi of 25.5.  I wear size 8/10 pants (and size 6 in one brand of jeans!) and size 6/8/10 tops depending on the cut. I'm always a small in sweaters nowadays.  Size large swims on me. To say I'm delighted is a vast understatement. Sure, I have a lot of skin issues left that I hope to have fixed by the fabulous Drs. Aly and Cram at Iowa City Plastic Surgery. They did my lower body lift (belt lipectomy) last summer and I am very pleased with their work. But, for the first time since high school I have a boyfriend who loves me and he doesn't care about the skin anyway, so it's just for me that I want to get the skin thing fixed. In clothes, except for my arms, no one can really tell that I was fat at all. I hope this post is helpful! Take care, Jill revision from band to DS 3/10/05 Dr. Baltasar, Spain (www.bodybybaltasar.com ) 440/435/153/149 hw/sw/cw/gw -287lbs, 4lbs to go! www.picturetrail.com/kilaani Hi guys, I'm scheduled for surgery March 10th and after reading some of the posts on here I'm beginning to worry. Does everyone have the smell problem? And if I could ask, how long was your recovery time after surgery?

I have a surgery date of March 10th in Bowling Green, Ohio  and up until this point I was looking forward to the beginning of a  new me. I still am but I'm starting to get the jitters a little  however I know that this is the best for me at this juncture of my  life. Not to mention the added years that I'll be able to see my kids  grow and their kids grow. I look forward to talking to everyone and  I'm positive that you'll be seeing alot more of me both before and  after surgery. >  > Thanks Again, >  > Mark >  >  >   >  >  >   >  > -----Original Message----- > From: Norine   > To: duodenalswitch@yahoogroups.com > Sent: Fri, 8 Feb 2008 6:58 pm > Subject: RE: [duodenalswitch] Pre op Patient.... >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  > Hi, Mark > I tend to think of myself as one of the âlucky onesâ in terms  of: > Smell is *very* well controlled by daily acidophilus intake (itâs  not as > bad as it was pre-op!) > Weight loss-Iâve lost 95% of my excess body weight > Food tolerance (untoasted bread, pasta and rice donât seem to set  well > in my tummy; other than that, I can and do eat almost anything and > everything, with the exception of I never have carbonated beverages  with > my meals) > I can apparently eat just about anything I want, and as long as I  get > enough protein, fluids, and my supplements every day, nothing seems  to > slow my weight loss. >   > Keep in mind, with *all* of these factors in place, I am the  *exception* > to the rule.

He is still in ICU and on the ventilator but his fluid output was good today and they are suctioning some of the fluid out of his lungs. His blood pressure and heart rate are pretty stable now. They are giving him medications to rid his body of the excess fluid and to try to make his blood cells stronger. If he has a good night tonight with no issues he will probably be able to get off the ventilator tomorrow.

Justin Piszcz <wqvmcqb@lucidpixels.com>,rljdsng-xyqoh@postfix.org,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 19:55:16 -0500",Question regarding timeouts.,"Question--

1. Are these typical to see in the logs?
2. Some are caused by using fail2ban of course, others by spammers.

$ grep 'timeout after' mail.log |\\
  sed 's/from/|/g' |\\
  awk '{print ""timeout after"",$8,$10}' |\\
  awk '{print $1,$2,$3}'|sort|uniq -c
     549 timeout after CONNECT
     613 timeout after DATA
     419 timeout after EHLO
      75 timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE
     137 timeout after HELO
     160 timeout after MAIL
     821 timeout after RCPT
     294 timeout after RSET

3. However, there are also some legitimate timeouts:

timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE vger.kernel.org[209.132.176.167]
timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE vger.kernel.org[209.132.176.167]
timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE vger.kernel.org[209.132.176.167]
timeout after EHLO vger.kernel.org[209.132.176.167]

timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE vger.kernel.org[209.132.176.167]
timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE vger.kernel.org[209.132.176.167]
timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE vger.kernel.org[209.132.176.167]

timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE 
qmta01.westchester.pa.mail.comcast.net[76.96.62.16]
timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE qmta02.emeryville.ca.mail.comcast.net[76.96.30.24]
timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE 
qmta09.westchester.pa.mail.comcast.net[76.96.62.96]
timeout after END-OF-MESSAGE

--

For awhile, I have had the following enabled (now using the defaults):

#smtpd_client_connection_count_limit = 25
#smtpd_client_connection_rate_limit = 50
#smtpd_error_sleep_time = 10
#smtpd_hard_error_limit = 5
#smtpd_junk_command_limit = 3
#smtpd_soft_error_limit = 2
#smtpd_timeout = 60s

These were mainly extracted from:
http://www.pantz.org/software/postfix/setuppostfix.html

That sounds likely. Thanks for the information.  I already have a filter installed immediately downstream of SA, so this is easy to check by extending it: any header byte containing 0x80 or higher is invalid because headers must be US-ASCII encoding (RFC 2821). I can log the details of any messages containing them. As for detoxifying the headers and stopping any further upsets, at a guess something like:     if (c > 0x7f)     {         c =  c & 0x80;         if (c < 0x20)             c = c + 'A"";     }  would detoxify the invalid header bytes headers without adding significant problems.

Marc Chamberlin <vrva@marcchamberlin.com>,wkilxloc@opensuse.org,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 17:15:36 -0800",[opensuse] ATI fglrx driver problems,"I have been working on trying to get a new system up an running for a  media center and guess you might say I have gotten a bit frustrated with  it. I am running SuSE 10.3 on a dual core Athelon x64 system with the  ATI Radeon x1900 card. I need to run this as a dual head system, one  head controlling a large LCD display over DVI and the other head  controlling a small LCD display over VESA. I need to have this working  in a clone mode as the small display is used for controlling the system  from another room.... During the course of my investigations I have discovered that neither  Sax2 nor Aticonfig can be relied on to set up xorg.conf correctly. Using  either of these tools will break my system and cause subsequent boots to  bring up a useless display on the large LCD monitor. (I am running it at  1920 x 1080 interlaced with a refresh rate of 30hz which is the ONLY  mode I have been able to get this to display properly) I have discovered  that both Sax2 and Aticonfig will trash xorg.conf and make changes to it  that are flat wrong (such as truncating decimal places in modelines or  even removing modelines and other settings entirely, not to mention that  the xorg.conf gets reorganized differently and thus causes the other  tool be become confused sometimes and then crash!) I strongly suspect  that both of these tools have expectations on how the xorg.conf file  should be laid out and organized and if the file deviates much (even  though the file is technically formatted correctly according to Xorg's  rules) then these tools are not robust enough to handle the variation.  Both tools could have used a lot better testing IMHO! I have simplified my xorg.conf to the point of having only one modeline  for my monitor and then tried to use aticonfig to build a dual head  version from there. But even after hand correcting the decimal  truncation error that aticonfig will do to it, I still have not had any  success getting a dual head configuration to work. So given that these tools are next to useless for me I decided the best  course was to try an hand modify/setup xorg.conf. After many many hours  of research I finally discovered that one can have the X server itself  generate an xorg.conf.new template file with all the possible settings  that the fglrx driver knows about. THERE ARE A LOT!!! And also, somewhat  amazingly, there is considerable differences elsewhere between what this  file suggests should be used and what Sax2 or Aticonfig generate! Next I  tried to track down documentation on what all these settings are and  discovered that ATI has done an incredibly poor job of documenting   their fglrx driver. Other distributions do have man pages which I found  on the internet that cover some of these but not all, and SuSE supplies  a bit of html documentation, again not thorough. Most of this is way  above my head anywise as I am NOT a video driver expert by any means, so  understanding it is extremely difficult if not impossible! I have not had any luck getting this dual head configuration to work  once SuSE has booted up and the X windows system (under KDE) takes over.  I have had some luck getting it to work in single head mode with the  main large LCD monitor, but to make matters worse my problem is  compounded by the fact that even when I do get it to boot up, the system  will only remain up for about 5 to 10 minutes before it freezes. Then  the only recourse is to reboot it. The X server will not respond to any  keyboard or mouse input at that point, not even a CTRL ALT Backspace to  restart it. This freeze happens regardless of whether I am trying to  configure the system as a dual head or as a single head system. It is  particularly sensitive to things like trying to run an openGL  application (such as a screen saver) which I have turned off, and I have  also turned off all power saving modes to eliminate those as possible  causes. It STILL freezes up in a short amount of time. I dunno if I can figure out how to get the xorg.conf file configured  right to support a dual head system and I dunno if my current  configuration is perhaps not quite right but at least for 10 or so  minutes it will give me a good display image so I must be close to  having the primary head configured right. I have been trying to track  down this instability and after many reboots and poking around one type  of warning message is often coming up in the WARN file under /var/logs  which I see a lot (but not always) as the last thing that happened  before I had to reboot from a freeze - Feb 10 17:42:31 nova kernel: [fglrx:firegl_free_mutex] *ERROR* mutex id  0x00000004 not found in mutex list Feb 10 17:42:40 nova kernel: [fglrx:firegl_free_mutex] *ERROR* mutex id  0x00000005 not found in mutex list If I had to guess this does seem rather serious as I would speculate  that this is a mutual exclusion semaphore that got lost somehow? (I am  an experienced programmer, though NOT a Linux wonk, and I do know that  if so, that could lead to deadlocks and all kinds of serious chaos such  as what I am experiencing with the whole system locking up on me. I have  tried to contact the ATI/AMD Linux Crew for the fglrx driver on this but  so far that has been like trying to talk to a black hole... No response  whatsoever.... (Have also complained about the serious lack of  documentation and that too has gotten no response..) I can post my xorg.conf, warn, message and Xorg.0.log files if some kind  ATI fglrx driver guru wants to help me out of this quagmire and would  like to see them. I am pretty close to giving up on ATI and go and plunk  down a few hundred sheckles on an nVidia card and try out their world  instead. As I said, trying to get this ATI card up and running has  turned into a real frustrating experience, just getting my large LCD  monitor up an running was a nightmare I don't ever want to go through  again, and now this! So bottom line, I have two serious issues to solve, how to configure my  system to use both monitors in a cloned dual head fashion, and how to  overcome these freezes that lock it up.

Something like remote access     ssh -qX  -q is for quiet -X is will make possible to call GUI applications Switch to root and do whatever has to be done.

They are not candidates for strong policies and getting any real benefit  and the DOMAIN will know that. If it wishes to continue to allow its  domain to be used in open and unknown highly exploitable manners, it  can't expect it be safe from abuse.  That was established long ago.  > I gather you may have some kludge to patch it  > up, but I don't think you can expect everyone else to do that. Exactly, which just reaffirms the fact anyone who is going to operate in  this relaxed exploitable manner SHOULD not expect any much benefit from  any of this. But you wish to deny domains, and in my view a vast number of domains,  the opportunity to get a high degree of benefit from DKIM+STRONG policy  modes of operation.  This ASP model lowers the incentive to support DKIM  where inherent default policy of domain abuse ignorance is the mantra. > Look back at Steve's previous messages.  If the domain's bad advice > makes the ISP drop mail its users want, the users will blame the ISP, > not the SSP record.   So? This sort of stuff commonly happens today in other ways!  In fact,  it is perfectly valid feedback in the support process to rectify the  situation in whatever it takes to do so. Certainly,  the DMA market has a right to do business with users in a  vendor-user relationship.  CAN-SPAM established this valid relationship. But, if the DMA market expects to raise the bar of standard SMTP  transactions by marking its SPAM with DKIM signatures and expects these  *highlighted* messages to help get their foot into the door, then they  should also realized by making its mail ""special"" it also comes with  special scrutiny as well. Can't have it both ways.  The DAC VBR-INFO  advice is only going to help tell us, ""So far So good."" However, if the DMA market wishes to really help themselves and tell  receivers that their new form of SPAM are have DKIM signatures, they can  help keep their reputation harm lower by exposing the idea received  unsigned messages purported from them are no good and should be  rejected, then we are all winners:        ""Sure, I send SPAM, but my own SPAM, not SPAM from others""  > This would make a reasonable ISP rather gunshy about believing  > the advice in random SSP records. It seems you are in denial of the quickly involving fact that DKIM is  becoming dubious with this ASP model. I can imagine HIGH_VALUE_DOMAIN.COM, a paying member of DAC is being  told by DAC to sign all its mail with DKIM and more importantly add the  VBR-INFO header too. But bad guys see this and say:       ""Hmmmmm, I better stay away from DKIM or any VBR-INFO and see       what happens."" So now receivers get HIGH_VALUE_DOMAIN.COM messages with no DKIM  signature, no policy information that one is required and no one to ask  about it. Who is harmed?    - Receivers with abused of their system,    - Domains with increased reputation harm of sending bad mail,    - End users who may be phishing victims, What's your answer to this? The only reasonable answer I see is SSP-02/ASP DKIM=DISCARDABLE or a  SSP-01 DKIM=STRICT|ALL set of policies that will provide a BIG hint to  the receiver unsigned message where it is expected is obviously fraud. But you want to deny this to any domain because you feel domains are  still going to allow ROAMING usage of their domain from any site or service. > There are certainly heavily phished domains that merit discarding, but > given what a small fraction of the total universe of mail they are, > it's much more likely that most of the domains that publish SSP > discardable will instead be due to admins who don't understand what it > means. The last time a protocol stated such insightful ""small numbers"" case:     RFC 2821:     7. Security Considerations     7.1 Mail Security and Spoofing     ...     This specification does not further address the authentication issues     associated with SMTP other than to advocate that useful functionality     not be disabled in the hope of providing some small margin of     protection against an ignorant user who is trying to fake mail. Got it so wrong to the tune of a 10's of billions dollars world wide  industry problem.  Its no longer a small margin of ignorant users but a  world wide industry problem. I hope we can keep flawed subjective policies like the above and being  repeated here, out of the DKIM POLICY protocol design process. --  Sincerely Hector Santos, CTO http://www.santronics.com http://santronics.blogspot.com ------------------------------ >From amaxcul.vdcyfoa@cs.tcd.ie  Sun Feb 24 10:27:39 2008 Message: 11 Date: Sat, 09 Feb 2008 12:36:51 +0000 From: Stephen Farrell  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] Return to issues?

However some of the recent discussion doesn't seem (to me) to be easily trackable in this way - there've been a good few fairly general/rambling posts that'd likely end up as vague issues.

I'm not sure which part is not understood. The phrase? the usage of  consistency? combine with fraud? Consistency in this technical sense deals with protocol logic, it means  that everything you measure (or get, receive) is ""consistent"" with what  expected to be true. Some definitions in the field: - ""propositions are consistent if they can all be true. A system of  propositions can be shown to be inconsistent if it contains a  contradiction (a proposition and its negation). Consistency and  completeness are two key concerns of modern logic."" - ""a harmonious uniformity or agreement among things or parts"" SSP-02, as I read it, does not allow a receiver or lets say removes the  incentive to perform a consistency check because the specification  allows for the inconsistent state to exist. > So far as I am aware, the SSP-02 /protocol/ is no weaker than in  > SSP-01.

Well, I don't think SSP is impose any requirements on the receiver.  It  is allowing the receiver to make the final decision with known facts  about what is inconsistent transactions. Most Receivers don't want any more junk than it has to take on. If it is  told ""Hey, this is junk. I don't care if you get rid of it."" then what  is the final outcome is really up to the receiver. But just consider that you just said.  Aren't you inherently imposing  rules on the receiver by indicating SSP should not telling what the  receiver can or can not do? > As I said before, my position is that as  > desirable as it may seem to put requirements on the receiver in order to  > guarantee consistent results, the reality is that the receivers will do  > whatever they want to in order to give the best results for themselves  > and their customers.   Exactly, but I believe SSP-02 has removing vital information from the  decision table, and therefore, in virtue of that decision to do this in  SSP-02, you are negatively imposing your own rules and policies on how  receivers should behave.  > Hence, saying ""no normative requirements for > receivers"" is in my mind just bowing to an inevitable reality. Don't you don't you will have a SPF SOFTFAIL like consequent with SSP-02  DKIM=ALL? > This is at the root of eliminating the concept of 3rd Party Signatures.   Sorry, I still don't follow the logic.  The decision is still not based  on technical merits but subjective policy making on the receiver. > They were only relevant in terms of how the receiver interprets the DKIM  > results, and hence inappropriate for discussion. Do you think everyone is going to implement DKIM as a stand-alone  appliance ""proxy"" box engine where it can be fed millions of messages  and its sole job to process these messages? If so, then I pity the general case receivers if you believe they are  going to tolerate such high volume overhead and abuse with little payoff  in return. Remember, DKIM eliminates the problem we had with SPF SOFTFAILS.  I  believe you have stated so yourself in DKIM Media Interviews. But if you  want results to be treated in the same way via SSP-02, people are going  to find that, unlike SPF, just REJECTING these ""softfails"" is a pretty  reliable bet As you said, you have no control of the receivers, but you are not  leaving them any choice either and as far as I am concern, DKIM is sure  to come out of the gate with a thorn on its side and a black eye with  this SSP-02 model > You say some things about the Evaluator that lead me to believe that  > you've got a different idea of what it should be than I do.

The standard track SSP protocol should have a protocol consistency check  before you subject the system with unknown out of scope evaluators. We had that before, now we don't and there is really no solid  engineering logic behind the removal. But its your bag and ball and I guess thats it.  ASP wins!  SSP is dead  and DKIM will be isolated to a limited market but not the general case,  where it will begin to be taken advantage of because of all the include  DKIM forge the SSP-02/ASP people don't want receivers to worry about -  right! --  Sincerely Hector Santos, CTO http://www.santronics.com http://santronics.blogspot.com ------------------------------ _______________________________________________ NOTE WELL: This list operates according to",0,1,social_media,social_media,social_media

Same for me, just haven't figured out when ""one day"" will be yet.
Every time I start thinking it's ""soon"", something else hits the fan.

                         CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

                    TEXT RETRIEVAL CONFERENCE (TREC)

                      February 2008 - November 2008

                          Conducted by:
      National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

                          With support from:
      Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)


The Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) workshop series encourages
research in information retrieval and related applications by
providing a large test collection, uniform scoring procedures,
and a forum for organizations interested in comparing their
results.  Now in its seventeenth year, the conference has become
the major experimental effort in the field.  Participants in
the previous TREC conferences have examined a wide variety
of retrieval techniques and retrieval environments,
including cross-language retrieval, retrieval of web documents,
multimedia retrieval, and question answering.  Details about TREC
can be found at the TREC web site,  http://trec.nist.gov .

You are invited to participate in TREC 2008.  TREC 2008 will
consist of a set of tasks known as ""tracks"".  Each track focuses
on a particular subproblem or variant of the retrieval task as
described below.  Organizations may choose to participate in any or
all of the tracks.  For most tracks, training and test materials are
available from NIST; a few tracks will use special collections that
are available from other organizations for a fee.


Dissemination of TREC work and results other than in the (publicly
available) conference proceedings is welcomed, but the conditions of
participation specifically preclude any advertising claims based
on TREC results.  All retrieval results submitted to NIST are
published in the Proceedings and are archived on the TREC web site.
The workshop in November is open only to participating groups that
submit retrieval results for at least one track and to selected
government personnel from sponsoring agencies.


Schedule:
--------

  By February 21 -- submit application described below
        to NIST.  Returning an application will add you to
        the active participants' mailing list.  On Feb 25,
        NIST will announce a new password for the ""active
        participants"" portion of the TREC web site.  Included
        in this portion of the web site is information regarding
        the permission forms needed to obtain the TREC document
        disks.

   Beginning March 1 -- document disks used in some existing
        TREC collections distributed to participants who have
        returned the required forms.  Please note that no disks
        will be shipped before March 1.

   mid-July--mid-August  -- results submission deadline for most tracks
       (Results deadline may need to be even earlier for
        some tracks depending on assessor availability.
        Specific deadlines for each track will be included in
        the track guidelines, which will be finalized in the spring.)

   September 9  (estimated) -- speaker proposals due at NIST.

   September 30 (estimated) -- relevance judgments and individual
        evaluation scores due back to participants.

   Nov 18-21 -- TREC 2008 conference at NIST in Gaithersburg, Md. USA


Task Description:
----------------
Below is a brief summary of the tasks.  Complete descriptions of
tasks performed in previous years are included in the Overview
papers in each of the TREC proceedings (in the Publications section
of the web site).

The exact definition of the tasks to be performed in each track for
TREC 2008 is still being formulated.  Track discussion takes place
on the track mailing list.  To be added to a track mailing list,
follow the instructions for contacting that mailing list as
given below.  For questions about the track, send mail to the
track coordinator (or post the question to the track mailing list
once you join).

TREC 2008 will have one new track and four continuing tracks.
The new track is the relevance feedback track, a track
that will systematically explore the factors that affect
relevance feedback behavior.  The blog, enterprise, legal, and
million query tracks will continue in TREC 2008, though the
specific tasks in a track may differ from year to year.
(Note that the QA track has been moved to the new Text Analysis
Conference (TAC); the call for participation in TAC
will be sent to the TREC friends mailing list.)

Blog Track -- The purpose of the blog track is to explore information
    seeking behavior in the blogosphere.

    Track coordinator: Iadh Ounis, mljfz@cs.gla.ac.uk
    Mailing list:  send a mail message to mardfyrx@nist.gov
        such that the body consists of the line
        subscribe trec-blog  


Enterprise Track -- The purpose of the enterprise track is
    to study enterprise search: satisfying a user who is
    searching the data of an organization to complete some task.

    Track coordinators: Nick Craswell, ukdbbk@microsoft.com
                        Ian Soboroff, jlz.pfohsudx@nist.gov
                        Arjen de Vries, dxxhp@acm.org
    Track web page: http://www.ins.cwi.nl/projects/trec-ent
    Mailing list:  send a mail message to mardfyrx@nist.gov
        such that the body consists of the line
        subscribe trec-ent  


Legal Track -- The goal of the legal track is to develop search technology
    that meets the needs of lawyers to engage in effective discovery
    in digital document collections.

    Track coordinators: Jason Baron, zjtta.dftmk@nara.gov
                        Doug Oard, rshh@umd.edu
    Track web page: http://trec-legal.umiacs.umd.edu
    Mailing list: contact rshh@umd.edu to be added to the list.

Million Query Track -- The goal of the ""million query"" track is to test
   the hypothesis that a test collection built from very many very
   incompletely judged topics is a better tool than a collection built
   using traditional TREC pooling.

   Track web page:  http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/research/million
   Mailing list: follow the instructions given on the track web page
                 to join the email list (etaylhm@cs.umass.edu)

Relevance Feedback Track -- The goal of the relevance feedback track
   is to provide a framework for exploring the effects of different
   factors on the success of relevance feedback.

   Track coordinators: Chris Buckley, gbxbtdvhq@sabir.com
                       Steve Robertson, bhl@microsoft.com
   Track web page:  http://groups.google.com/group/trec-relfeed
   Mailing list: follow the instructions given on the track web page
                 to join the email list


Conference Format
-------------------------

The conference itself will be used as a forum both for presentation
of results (including failure analyses and system comparisons),
and for more lengthy system presentations describing retrieval
techniques used, experiments run using the data, and other issues
of interest to researchers in information retrieval.  As there
is a limited amount of time for these presentations, the TREC
program committee will determine which groups are asked to speak
and which groups will present in a poster session.  Groups that
are interested in having a speaking slot during the workshop
should submit a 200-300 word abstract in September describing
the experiments they performed.  The program committee will use
these abstracts to select speakers.

As some organizations may not wish to describe their proprietary
algorithms, TREC defines two categories of participation.

Category A: Full participation
  Participants will be expected to present full details of system
  algorithms and various experiments run using the data, either in
  a talk or in a poster session.

Category C: Evaluation only
  Participants in this category will be expected to submit results
  for common scoring and tabulation, and present their results in
  a poster session.  They will not be expected to describe their
  systems in minute detail, but will be expected to describe the
  general approach and report on time and effort statistics.


Data
----
Many of the existing TREC English collections (documents, topics,
and relevance judgments) are available for training purposes and
may also be used in some of the tracks.  Parts of the training
collection (Disks 1-3) were assembled from Linguistic Data
Consortium (LDC) text, and a signed User Agreement will be required
from all participants.  The documents are an assorted collection
of newspapers, newswires, journals, and technical abstracts.
The LDC has collected a more recent set of newswire material called
the AQUAINT collection (Disks 6&7); this collection will also
be available to TREC participants but is covered by a separate
User Agreement.  A third Agreement is needed for the remaining
disks (4-5).

All documents are typical of those seen in a real-world situation
(i.e. there will not be arcane vocabulary, but there may be
missing pieces of text or typographical errors).  For most tracks,
the relevance judgments against which each system's output will be
scored will be made by experienced relevance assessors based on the
output of all TREC participants using a pooled relevance methodology.
See the Overview paper in the TREC-8 proceedings (on the TREC
web site) for a detailed discussion of pooling.


Response format and submission details:
---------------------------------------

Organizations wishing to participate in TREC 2008 should respond
to this call for participation by submitting an application.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Participants in previous TRECs who will participate
in TREC 2008 must submit a new application.

An application consists of the following five parts:
1. Contact information:
      * The full name of the main contact person from your organization.

      * The full name of your organization.  If you are not
        participating as a member of an organization,
        please specify ""self"".  If you know there is another group
        from your organization that will also participate in TREC 2008
        (for example, two groups from the same university),
        please give enough qualification in the organization name
        to distinguish the different groups.

      * An organization/team name (up to 20 characters) used as a
        unique identifier for your group.  You will need to use this
        identifier on correspondence to NIST (when requesting
        data or sending permission forms, for example), so
        remember it.  This identifier will also be used to tag your
        runs when you submit them.

      * Complete organization physical mail address---sufficient
        such that mail sent to that address will be accepted
        by the post office.

      * Fully qualified phone and fax numbers for the main contact person.

      * Fully qualified, valid email address for the main contact person.

      * Exactly ONE fully qualified, valid email address to use
        for the TREC 2008 participants' mailing list.
        Because of the overhead involved in maintaining the mailing list
        of active participants, only one email address per participating
        group will be added to the TREC 2008 participants' list.
        We strongly encourage the use of a local mailing list at
        your institution that distributes TREC mail internally to
        project participants so that all involved see the mail sent
        to this list.  TREC is run solely be email, so it is
        important that this address be valid and that mail
        sent to the address is read in a timely fashion.
        You may use the email address of the main contact person
        as the address for the mailing list, but please give
        it twice in the application so we are sure of your intentions.

2. Whether you have participated in TREC before.  If so, please
   indicate the years you participated, otherwise indicate that you
   are new to TREC.

3. A one-paragraph description of your retrieval approach.

4. Whether you will participate as a Category A or a
   Category C group.

5. A list of tracks that you are likely to participate in.
   This is non-binding, but is helpful to know for planning.

There is no application form as such; a simple text file consisting
of this information by number is the application.
Please respond using only simple text (i.e., no pdf, word,
rtf, postscript, etc. files).  We will not process your application
to participate in TREC 2008 unless it is complete.


All responses should be mailed to Lori Buckland, lori.buckland@nist.gov.
Any questions about conference participation, response format, etc.
should be sent to the general TREC email address, wwxj@nist.gov .

the RH chkconfig lines contain both startup and shutdown priorities. OP 
has probably posted the shutdown priorities, which are ok.

Excuse the strong language ; )  I just did a search here on Arnica Montana and I bought some yesterday. Problem . . . ya'll  said to start it at least a month B4 surgery and I'm under the knife on Friday! I hope it is  still worth taking. Opinions on that? I bought 30X in pill form @ Wild Oats. TG it isn't expensive. I quit the Cipro on Sunday, last and had to go back on Friday and get yet another antibiotic  for recurring infection. I don't know if my thighs (really need the thighoplasty) is part of it.  Hopefully the hernia repairs will take care of it. Thighs will come next when I have healed  enough and the docs decide I can be done. I had to make a choice between the thighs and  the hernia. I know the PS will fix the ugly scars the hernia repair leaves. I'll be glad when I  don't have to face surgery again. It is a good thing, though. I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have in  months. I don't want to be rushing into things after surgery. I get antsy knowing that  'things' need to be done. I have a male friend coming to 'babysit' me during recovery. Sure  hope I don't have to get nekked in front of him. I'll cry! (He's had an RNY) The good news:  my labs are at high normal. I'm amazed. I try my best to keep up my  supplements. I don't have a good memory even with a memory-minder for my pills. I still  have a problem with drinking enough. I just can't hold much and I tend to overdo and get  a tummy ache.  So far the OMNIGEST is giving me incredible indigestion. I suppose it is helping digest my  food but ouch! I'll keep at it for awhile and see if things settle down. Once again, let me say . . . this list is a lifesaver (you guys=wild cherry!) for me. I always  seem to find answers to questions I haven't even thought to ask. hugz dew DS 4/28/05 Dr. McConnell VA Hospital PDX           Back to top                       Reply to sender  |                        Reply to group  |                        Reply via web post               Messages in this topic             (2)                     9b.

This is the dose Dr Kuster recommends for 30 days pre and  post-op.. I would think the SOONER you start the sooner it will  help. Better a little late than not at all. Hope you still get help  from it.. some help is better than not having taken it at all.  Ginger <><  --- In duodenalswitch@yahoogroups.com, ""dsdewdrop""   wrote: > > Oh schucky-darn!

I had faxing under hylafax, with jhylafax as the gui, set up under openSuSE 10.1.  I did an upgrade to 10.2 on the system, but not having much need to fax recently I did not bother to try setting it up until now.

These Re-Spin ISOs are based on the officially released Fedora 8 installation media and include all updates released as of February 4,2008. The ISO images are available for i386 and x86_64 architectures via jigdo starting Thursday, February 7, 2008. We have included CD Image sets for those in the Fedora community that do not have DVD drives or burners available. During the Testing phase some of our testers had problems with installing via VNC while others did not have any problems at all. Please report your results in our bug tracker.  http://bugs.fedoraunity.org/spin-bugs/10/ We would like to give a special thanks to the following for testing this respin in 2 days Harley-D Dana Hoffman Jr zcat Jason Farrell Iwolf Jeffrey Tadlock Southern_Gentleman Ben Williams kanarip Jeroen van Meeuwen Fedora Unity has taken up the Re-Spin task to provide the community with the chance to install Fedora with recent updates already included. These updates might otherwise comprise more than 1.33GiB of downloads for a full install. This is a community project, for and by the community. You can contribute to the community by joining our test process. A full list of bugs, packages and changelogs that have been updated in this Re-Spin can be reviewed on http://spins.fedoraunity.org/changelogs/20080204/ If you are interested in helping with the testing or mirroring efforts, please contact the Fedora Unity team. Contact information is available at http://fedoraunity.org/ or the #fedora-unity channel on the Freenode IRC Network (irc.freenode.net). Go to http://spins.fedoraunity.org/spins to get the bits!

Do you want to predict the instances in the second dataset? A test set, as the name indicates, is for testing the performance of a classifier, i.e., the class labels must be present in order to compare them with the output generated by the classifier and to compute a few statistics. Having only missing class labels in there, of course, generates the above output. If you want to predict the class label of unlabeled data, then please have a look at FAQ ""How do I make predictions with a trained model?"". Link to the FAQs available on the Weka homepage.

You can't tell the CSVLoader what fields are nominal. If it contains  only numeric values, it assumes that this is a numeric attribute. You  can use the following filter for converting a numeric attribute into a  nominal one (only developer version; since 3.5.4):    weka.filters.unsupervised.attribute.NumericToNominal > I must use the command line. I am using WEKA from within MATLAB. > By the way, if anyone knows how to redirect the javaMethod() output > into a file, rather then stdout, I would love to hear the solution. > For now, I am using > system('java weka.core.converters.CSVLoader inputMatlab.csv > filename.arff'); > for redirection, which is quite ugly in my opinion. The intention (at least I think so) was using normal Unix piping to do  other stuff with the generated output. E.g., loading a CSV file,  converting it into ARFF and outputting some statistics: java weka.core.converters.CSVLoader anneal.csv | \\    java weka.core.Instances BTW you can always write your own encapsulating Java class if you're not  happy with the way it's working right now. Read FAQ ""How do I use Weka's  classes in my own code?"". Link to the FAQs is on the Weka homepage.

However, I'm seeing intermittent hangs with 169.09, still, also at writing caches.  I have 4GB of RAM, on a 32-bit system with highmem.

I'm not saying that I have much experience, but in the last few days, I forgot (without intent) to run glxgears prior to doing the hibernation, and I had good success! No hang anymore (despite my post from last Friday). I'm also using 169.09.

You might want system().     my $result = system 'tomahawk',         '-f', $packet_trace_file_name;  # or whatever Did I guess correctly that you want to run another program from Perl?

Let me know if your technique helps you to learn regular expressions. You will also have the chance to learn how complex a data format HTML is, and why parsers are more complex than simple pattern matches. For other people who want to learn more about regular expressions, I'd recommend the book ""Mastering Regular Expressions"" by Jeffrey Friedl. REs are a small language of their own, worthy of study. This book has interesting, useful, and practical information for any programmer who works with regular expressions. In fact, when the book first came out, everyone was expecting that any ""book"" on REs would be a pocket reference. Everyone was stunned at how much of this fat book was news even to the experts. (Several bugs and shortcomings of Perl's RE engine were fixed as a direct result of that first edition.) I'm sure that anyone who frequently uses Perl's patterns, or any other regular expressions, will find this book informative today.     http://regex.info/ Cheers! --Tom Phoenix Stonehenge Perl Training --iliclgfmceejibbpfidi Content-Type: message/rfc822 Content-Disposition: inline; filename >From cjeibunfyetzcu@gmail.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:35 2008 To: soiofdvxg@perl.org From: cjeibunfyetzcu@gmail.com Subject: Help on perl alarm Date: Tue, 5 Feb 2008 07:22:08 -0800 (PST) Message-ID:  Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text/plain; charsetContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit I am using perl alarm within a script and having an issue.

How simply awful. Lets reformat this so it's a little more legible: else {    $cmd      perl -e '        alarm(5);        exec qq/          ${rdist} -cR \\$srcdir $ENV{host}:          \\$destdir || ${scp} -pr \\$srcdir $ENV{host}:          \\$destdir        /      '    "" } now from your error messages I would guess that    $rdist  and    $scp  or something like that, so your Perl now becomes: else {    $cmd      perl -e '        alarm(5);        exec qq/          /usr/bin/rdist -cR \\$srcdir $ENV{host}:          \\$destdir || /usr/bin/scp -pr \\$srcdir $ENV{host}:          \\$destdir        /      '    "" } Can you see now why you're getting a syntax error? But your concept is far too convoluted. You have a Perl process that's shelling out to another Perl process, that in turn is shelling out to run rsh and/or ssh. Also, where are $srcdir and $destdir coming from? I suggest you rewrite as a Perl program that shells out, if necessary only one level to rsh, and verifies the return status to determine whether to also use ssh in the same way. I hope this helps a little.

I'm attaching the mail which caused this.  I know it is not properly-formatted, but it is a legitimate mail produced by a popular MUA (Thunderbird 1.5).  Spam surely is worsely formatted

Someone talked about the same problem in the list: http://www.mail-archive.com/ttrbkgvhb@python.org/msg04543.html

I'm seeing a lot (>1 per hour in my system) of current spam crashing
spambayes because they are marked as ""ascii"" but body is 8-bit actually.

Since my milter spam filter crashes and sendmail disables the milter
filtering for 50 seconds because the failure (my configuration, and I
wouldn't like to touch it), a lot of spam is getting thru. About 30-100
spams, everytime this bug hits.

Please, increase the priority of this bug a bit... It is hitting. Hard.

Summary: Classifier UnicodeDecodeError on wrong transfer encoding

Initial Comment:
Running ``sb_imapfilter.py`` 1.0.1 seems to raise the following ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when it comes across a mail with 7-bit content transfer encoding with 8-bit characters in it while classifying::

  UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)

I'm attaching the mail which caused this.  I know it is not properly-formatted, but it is a legitimate mail produced by a popular MUA (Thunderbird 1.5).  Spam surely is worsely formatted

I'm seeing a lot (>1 per hour in my system) of current spam crashing
spambayes because they are marked as ""ascii"" but body is 8-bit actually.

Since my milter spam filter crashes and sendmail disables the milter
filtering for 50 seconds because the failure (my configuration, and I
wouldn't like to touch it), a lot of spam is getting thru. About 30-100
spams, everytime this bug hits.

Please, increase the priority of this bug a bit... It is hitting. Hard.

I ran the submitted email through the current sb_filter.py in Subversion
(probably the same classifier as in 1.1a4).  It worked for me.  While I
don't use the IMAP filter, any of the SpamBayes applications should use the
same classifier code.  I'm not sure this is a problem in the current code. 
What version of SpamBayes are you using?

Summary: Classifier UnicodeDecodeError on wrong transfer encoding

Initial Comment:
Running ``sb_imapfilter.py`` 1.0.1 seems to raise the following ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when it comes across a mail with 7-bit content transfer encoding with 8-bit characters in it while classifying::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ""/usr/bin/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 924, in ?
      run()
    File ""/usr/bin/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 914, in run
      imap_filter.Filter()
    File ""/usr/bin/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 785, in Filter
      self.unsure_folder)
    File ""/usr/bin/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 703, in Filter
      evidence=True)
    File ""/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/spambayes/classifier.py"", line 190, in chi2_spamprob
      clues = self._getclues(wordstream)
    File ""/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/spambayes/classifier.py"", line 496, in _getclues
      clues.sort()
  UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)

I'm attaching the mail which caused this.  I know it is not properly-formatted, but it is a legitimate mail produced by a popular MUA (Thunderbird 1.5).  Spam surely is worsely formatted

Someone talked about the same problem in the list: http://www.mail-archive.com/ttrbkgvhb@python.org/msg04543.html

I ran the submitted email through the current sb_filter.py in Subversion
(probably the same classifier as in 1.1a4).  It worked for me.  While I
don't use the IMAP filter, any of the SpamBayes applications should use the
same classifier code.  I'm not sure this is a problem in the current code. 
What version of SpamBayes are you using?

Do you have a traceback?  What version of SpamBayes are you using?

I'm seeing a lot (>1 per hour in my system) of current spam crashing
spambayes because they are marked as ""ascii"" but body is 8-bit actually.

Since my milter spam filter crashes and sendmail disables the milter
filtering for 50 seconds because the failure (my configuration, and I
wouldn't like to touch it), a lot of spam is getting thru. About 30-100
spams, everytime this bug hits.

Please, increase the priority of this bug a bit... It is hitting. Hard.

Summary: Classifier UnicodeDecodeError on wrong transfer encoding

Initial Comment:
Running ``sb_imapfilter.py`` 1.0.1 seems to raise the following ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when it comes across a mail with 7-bit content transfer encoding with 8-bit characters in it while classifying::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ""/usr/bin/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 924, in ?
      run()
    File ""/usr/bin/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 914, in run

      clues.sort()
  UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)

I'm attaching the mail which caused this.  I know it is not properly-formatted, but it is a legitimate mail produced by a popular MUA (Thunderbird 1.5).  Spam surely is worsely formatted

Someone talked about the same problem in the list: http://www.mail-archive.com/ttrbkgvhb@python.org/msg04543.html

I ran the submitted email through the current sb_filter.py in Subversion
(probably the same classifier as in 1.1a4).  It worked for me.  While I
don't use the IMAP filter, any of the SpamBayes applications should use the
same classifier code.  I'm not sure this is a problem in the current code. 
What version of SpamBayes are you using?

Do you have a traceback?  What version of SpamBayes are you using?

I'm seeing a lot (>1 per hour in my system) of current spam crashing
spambayes because they are marked as ""ascii"" but body is 8-bit actually.

Since my milter spam filter crashes and sendmail disables the milter
filtering for 50 seconds because the failure (my configuration, and I
wouldn't like to touch it), a lot of spam is getting thru. About 30-100
spams, everytime this bug hits.

Please, increase the priority of this bug a bit... It is hitting. Hard.

Summary: Classifier UnicodeDecodeError on wrong transfer encoding

Initial Comment:
Running ``sb_imapfilter.py`` 1.0.1 seems to raise the following ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when it comes across a mail with 7-bit content transfer encoding with 8-bit characters in it while classifying::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ""/usr/bin/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 924, in ?
      run()
    File ""/usr/bin/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 914, in run

      clues.sort()
  UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)

I'm attaching the mail which caused this.  I know it is not properly-formatted, but it is a legitimate mail produced by a popular MUA (Thunderbird 1.5).  Spam surely is worsely formatted

Someone talked about the same problem in the list: http://www.mail-archive.com/ttrbkgvhb@python.org/msg04543.html

jcea,

Do you have an email message I can work with?  If so, zip it and send it
to me as an attachment (iybz@pobox.com).

Thx,

Skip

I ran the submitted email through the current sb_filter.py in Subversion
(probably the same classifier as in 1.1a4).  It worked for me.  While I
don't use the IMAP filter, any of the SpamBayes applications should use the
same classifier code.  I'm not sure this is a problem in the current code. 
What version of SpamBayes are you using?

I'm seeing a lot (>1 per hour in my system) of current spam crashing
spambayes because they are marked as ""ascii"" but body is 8-bit actually.

Since my milter spam filter crashes and sendmail disables the milter
filtering for 50 seconds because the failure (my configuration, and I
wouldn't like to touch it), a lot of spam is getting thru. About 30-100
spams, everytime this bug hits.

Please, increase the priority of this bug a bit... It is hitting. Hard.

Hi. There is support of permanent swap storage in TuxOnIce. Option is called TOI_KEEP_IMAGE. However you should mount all filesystems read-only since ""hibernated"" OS image can't know anything about FS changes. --  WBR, Dmitry -------------- next part -------------- A non-text attachment was scrubbed...

It's only possible to do this if the partitions that you have mounted  when you hibernate are unchanging. If they're modified after you  hibernate, the information about the filesystem in the hibernation image  won't match what's actually on the filesystem anymore, and you'll get  corruption of the filesystem. If you're able to work within these constraints, you want to enable the  'Keep Image mode' when configuring the kernel, and enable it by putting  1 into the /sys/power/tuxonice/keep_image file that will be found in the  resulting kernel. You can then hibernate once. Resuming will not remove  the image and subsequent attempts to hibernate will simply power off.  The image can be removed by doing echo 0 >  /sys/power/tuxonice/image_exists. The keep image functionality isn't  used a lot, so you might find a bug or two. If so, please let me know  and I'll fix anything problematic.

Hmm, this is a bit odd. I was going to go back and grab a copy of the HTML content from one of these messages showing the hyperlink, but it wasn't there. I read all my list mail in GMail, so I asked it to give me a copy of the ""original"" message source and the spambayesInfo URL doesn't appear anywhere in the source. The only mailing list footer is a plain-text only MIME section at the bottom of the message, yet when viewing that message inside GMail there is a clickable hyperlink that results in a ""mail.python.org Mailing Lists"" list page with the message ""No such list spambayesinfo"" at the top. It's almost as if GMail is inferring a hyperlink there, but I can't figure out why or where it came up with the link because the spambayesInfo name doesn't even appear in any of the mail header fields. If you're interested, here's the complete message source that I got back from GMail. You can see that it does contain an HTML-formatted version of the message in the multipart MIME, but it does *not* contain an HTML version of the mailing list footer. >From luhyvkqkl-hozvcoc@python.org  Wed May  7 23:53:27 2008 Delivered-To: jmmli.mikj@gmail.com Received: by 10.78.179.3 with SMTP id b3cs18640huf;         Fri, 28 Sep 2007 06:30:42 -0700 (PDT) Received: by 10.65.61.5 with SMTP id o5mr7604695qbk.1190986240022;         Fri, 28 Sep 2007 06:30:40 -0700 (PDT) Return-Path:  Received: from smtp-vbr7.xs4all.nl (smtp-vbr7.xs4all.nl [194.109.24.27])         by mx.google.com with ESMTP id 34si72702nfu.2007.09.28.06.30.23;         Fri, 28 Sep 2007 06:30:39 -0700 (PDT) Received-SPF: neutral (google.com: 194.109.24.27 is neither permitted nor denied by best guess record for domain of luhyvkqkl-hozvcoc@python.org) client-ip=194.109.24.27; Authentication-Results: mx.google.com; spf=neutral (google.com: 194.109.24.27 is neither permitted nor denied by best guess record for domain of luhyvkqkl-hozvcoc@python.org) agga.hirg=khoffwtea-ggahirg@python.org Received: from bag.python.org (bag.python.org [194.109.207.14]) 	by smtp-vbr7.xs4all.nl (8.13.8/8.13.8) with ESMTP id l8SDSE7S010378; 	Fri, 28 Sep 2007 15:28:23 +0200 (CEST) 	(envelope-from luhyvkqkl-hozvcoc@python.org) Received: from bag.python.org (bag [127.0.0.1]) 	by bag.python.org (Postfix) with ESMTP id 6F8091E400F; 	Fri, 28 Sep 2007 15:28:14 +0200 (CEST) X-Original-To: ttrbkgvhb@python.org Delivered-To: ttrbkgvhb@bag.python.org Received: from bag.python.org (bag [127.0.0.1]) 	by bag.python.org (Postfix) with ESMTP id 92F5D1E400D 	for ; Fri, 28 Sep 2007 15:28:12 +0200 (CEST) X-Spam-Status: OK 0.283 X-Spam-Level: ** Received: from bag (HELO bag.python.org) (127.0.0.1) 	by bag.python.org with SMTP; 28 Sep 2007 15:28:12 +0200 Received: from mailrelay.embarq.synacor.com (mailrelay.embarq.synacor.com 	[208.47.184.3]) by bag.python.org (Postfix) with ESMTP 	for ; Fri, 28 Sep 2007 15:28:09 +0200 (CEST) X_CMAE_Category: 0,0 Undefined,Undefined X-CNFS-Analysis: v=1.0 c=1 a=bDZf-hiUAAAA:8 a=uZaO26zKCG1hwd7DcXwA:9 	a=JLoLedn8_sZQlPhFTrYA:7 a=eWcznnakSMoiXw2l1nXcckFRakAA:4 	a=begle0EBvngA:10 a=8UrxtZQlJLQA:10 a=CJge89XrRHUA:10 	a=rl0z1pC05qIA:10 a=igkdSQrOE6AA:10 a=UAZALQJaam5NKcqJVAYA:9 	a=9E8deBQlciORg-mNlxIA:7 a=tfy5mZt21pgCrgPk0T-vlZi79JMA:4 	a=AfD3MYMu9mQA:10 X-CM-Score: 0 X-Scanned-by: Cloudmark Authority Engine Authentication-Results: smtp08.embarq.synacor.com 	yimm.euud=ucjv@hardwooddesigns.com; spf=unknown Authentication-Results: smtp08.embarq.synacor.com 	wolh.ixge=xlnvpebwwolhi@embarqmail.com; auth=pass (LOGIN) Received-SPF: error (smtp08.embarq.synacor.com: 63.162.203.184 is neither 	permitted nor denied by domain of hardwooddesigns.com Received: from [63.162.203.184] ([63.162.203.184:42497] helo=JANPC) 	by mailrelay.embarq.synacor.com (envelope-from 	) (ecelerity 2.2.0.18 r(18773)) with ESMTPA 	id 87/C0-15541-8610DF64; Fri, 28 Sep 2007 09:28:08 -0400 From: ""Jan Bouterse""  To:  Date: Fri, 28 Sep 2007 09:28:08 -0400 Message-ID: <001101c801d3$68c00100$0e01a8c0@hardwood.local> MIME-Version: 1.0 X-Mailer: Microsoft Office Outlook 11 Thread-Index: AcgB02f+3gdRmfsYQUChkF/j3Ig8Xw== X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V6.00.2900.3138 Subject: [Spambayes] question X-BeenThere: ttrbkgvhb@python.org X-Mailman-Version: 2.1.9 Precedence: list List-Id: Discussion list for Pythonic Bayesian classifier 	 List-Unsubscribe: , 	 List-Archive:  List-Post:  List-Help:  List-Subscribe: , 	 Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=""===============0576480163=="" Sender: luhyvkqkl-hozvcoc@python.org Errors-To: luhyvkqkl-hozvcoc@python.org X-Virus-Scanned: by XS4ALL Virus Scanner This is a multi-part message in MIME format. --===============0576480163== Content-Type: multipart/alternative; 	boundary=""----=_NextPart_000_0012_01C801B1.E1AE6100"" This is a multi-part message in MIME format. ------=_NextPart_000_0012_01C801B1.E1AE6100 Content-Type: text/plain; 	charset=""US-ASCII"" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit First, let me commend you on your awesome program!

Summary: Classifier UnicodeDecodeError on wrong transfer encoding

Initial Comment:
Running ``sb_imapfilter.py`` 1.0.1 seems to raise the following ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when it comes across a mail with 7-bit content transfer encoding with 8-bit characters in it while classifying::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File ""/usr/bin/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 924, in ?
      run()
    File ""/usr/bin/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 914, in run

      clues.sort()
  UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)

I'm attaching the mail which caused this.  I know it is not properly-formatted, but it is a legitimate mail produced by a popular MUA (Thunderbird 1.5).  Spam surely is worsely formatted

Someone talked about the same problem in the list: http://www.mail-archive.com/ttrbkgvhb@python.org/msg04543.html

jcea,

Do you have an email message I can work with?  If so, zip it and send it
to me as an attachment (iybz@pobox.com).

Thx,

Skip

I ran the submitted email through the current sb_filter.py in Subversion
(probably the same classifier as in 1.1a4).  It worked for me.  While I
don't use the IMAP filter, any of the SpamBayes applications should use the
same classifier code.  I'm not sure this is a problem in the current code. 
What version of SpamBayes are you using?

I'm seeing a lot (>1 per hour in my system) of current spam crashing
spambayes because they are marked as ""ascii"" but body is 8-bit actually.

Since my milter spam filter crashes and sendmail disables the milter
filtering for 50 seconds because the failure (my configuration, and I
wouldn't like to touch it), a lot of spam is getting thru. About 30-100
spams, everytime this bug hits.

Please, increase the priority of this bug a bit... It is hitting. Hard.

For anybody following along who cares... it turned out it was 
zero-length messages causing the problem.  mass-check now handles this.

Has Cameron fractured Labour's lead?
=====================================

Hold it folks�  Channel 4 News publishes the first opinion poll since the Cameron speech - and it makes very interesting reading too.

I�m not at liberty to disclose what it says, tune in at seven to find out more. 

But I can tell you that if you stop a politician and you ask them about the polls they give you a completely different view from what the media tell you. And then again the media then enjoys displaying the politicians� contrary view.

So, tonight: the poll. Cathy Newman will be exploring what it tells us - is an election more or less likely?

And you can read the poll results for yourself on our website as we go to air. The results will be published on this page:

Bookmark it, save it, and read it at 7pm.


Diana fever
===========

And as for Diana, you guessed it, a whole lot more pictures that give us almost no further information, except that she was blonde, he was dark, and they were both in the same hotel at the same time, and didn�t live to tell the tale.

But it still has some sort of irresistible lure, as if we�re looking at forbidden, secret moments of some distant event. Which of course we are.

See our coverage here: http://tinyurl.com/2eqlcm


Internet fraud
===============

There�s a very nasty story involving very vulnerable people being taken for a ride by ruthless fraudsters, involving internet, email and cheque deception, worth about �8.5m. Simon Israel will have the full details.


Postal pain
===========

There�s an uncomfortable postal strike: uncomfortable for the government, uncomfortable for the consumer, and uncomfortable for the unions. Nick Martin is in amongst it, with the detail, at seven.

Hamilton docked points?
========================

There�s also an amazing story tonight about Lewis Hamilton the Formula One driver, who appears to be being investigated by the F1 authorities over allegations that he may have indulged in a spot of illegal braking over the course of the Japanese grand prix, which he went on to win.

Supposed evidence has been posted on YouTube by somebody who shot the incident from the stands. We are investigating, and m�learned friend is at hand.

Korea: peace on the cards?
===========================

Lindsey Hilsum is in the Far East tonight, casting an overview on the summit between North and South Korea. Can it really be peace in our time? It looks like it might be, but one slightly doubts that North Korea can be George Bush�s Nixonian moment in China.


Secret archive of Haile Selassie
=================================

There is a highly interesting offering from Nick Glass tonight on Haile Selassie�s photographer. This is a guy who photographed the Lion of Judah for many years until the Ethiopian Revolution produced the tyrant Mengistu (currently in hiding in Zimbabwe).

The photographer was never able to leave after Selassie�s demise, and therefore simply went on taking pictures of Mengistu. He hid his entire collection in his attic and now at last they are being displayed, and extraordinary they are.

So do join us at seven.

Jon.

Call it a ""DKIM Evaluator"". Its function is to examine all the available   signatures (including the precise forms of their tags), to compare them   with the various From, Sender, Whatever-Else headers that one would expect   to be matched by those signatures, and to report where that matching is   deficient having regard to the SSP policies and their severities   appropriate to those headers. Armed with this ""DKIM evaluation report"", the verifier now knows how the   sender(s) would like their messages to be treated. On top of this, the   verifier can also consider other evidence in its possession, its clients'   preferences and its own internal policies and then proceed as it sees fit.   But that process should be called the ""Local Evaluator"", and should not be   described in the SSP document beyond a mention that it will likely exists.   But the ""DKIM evaluator"" can and should be fully described. --  Charles�H.�Lindsey�---------At�Home,�doing�my�own�thing------------------------ Tel:�+44�161�436�6131�                       ���Web:�http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~chl Email:�wyz@clerew.man.ac.uk������Snail:�5�Clerewood�Ave,�CHEADLE,�SK8�3JU,�U.K. PGP:�2C15F1A9������Fingerprint:�73�6D�C2�51�93�A0�01�E7�65�E8�64�7E�14�A4�AB�A5 ------------------------------ >From amaxcul.vdcyfoa@cs.tcd.ie  Sun Feb 24 10:27:27 2008 Message: 2 Date: Mon, 11 Feb 2008 13:13:49 +0000 From: Stephen Farrell  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02.txt ASP/SSP section 	2.8 To: Charles Lindsey  Cc: DKIM  Message-ID: <47B04A0D.8040206@cs.tcd.ie> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed If you (or Hector, or whoever) have suggested changes for ssp-02 please raise an issue, including suggested new text and we can process that.

This draft is a work item of the Domain Keys Identified Mail Working Group of the IETF. 	Title           : DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Service Overview 	Author(s)       : T. Hansen, et al. 	Filename        : draft-ietf-dkim-overview-08.txt 	Pages           : 23 	Date            : 2008-02-11 This document provides an overview of the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) service and describes how it can fit into a messaging service. It also describes how DKIM relates to other IETF message signature technologies.  It is intended for those who are adopting, developing, or deploying DKIM.  DKIM allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be validated by a recipient.  The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents. An organization may use one or more domain names to accomplish this. DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public-key cryptography and key server technology [RFC4871].  This permits verifying a message source, an intermediary, or one of their agents, as well as the integrity of its contents.  DKIM will also provide a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages.  Such protection of email identity can assist in the global control of ""spam"" and ""phishing"".

Not at all.  It means that the author domain has some control but not perfect control over its signing practices, and there will always be paths that break SSP, e.g., mail-an-article, roaming users sending through hotel MTAs, mailing lists, forwarders that replace Sender lines, we all know what they are. >   And I'd like to understand where you get a ""noticeable"" chunk as >   we've been running DKIM signing for almost 2 years now and even >   with diverse mail use patterns of your average mega-corp we still >   get 99%+ verification rates. I'm not sure how average a megacorp Cisco is.  I'll bet Cisco users send way less HTML mail that most other businesses, for example.  What do you do about lists like this one that mutate the headers in ways that break signatures?  I gather you may have some kludge to patch it up, but I don't think you can expect everyone else to do that. >   Sure.

If the domain's bad advice makes the ISP drop mail its users want, the users will blame the ISP, not the SSP record.  This would make a reasonable ISP rather gunshy about believing the advice in random SSP records.   There are certainly heavily phished domains that merit discarding, but given what a small fraction of the total universe of mail they are, it's much more likely that most of the domains that publish SSP discardable will instead be due to admins who don't understand what it means.

Apparently your other client doesn't expunge the mails after deleting
them, so this is the expected behaviour in SquirrelMail. You can configure
SquirrelMail to do the expunging to get rid of those mails for good. Run
""config/conf.pl"", choose ""3. Folder Defaults"", and then ""11. Auto Expunge
: true"".

For every dataset that CVParameterSelection (= CVPS) is trained with, it  tries to find the optimal parameters (based on the parameter range  provided by the user) through internal cross-validation. Since you're  using attribute selection (= AS), CVPS will use whatever dataset it gets  from the AS scheme to optimize. And if you're using 10-fold CV in the  Explorer, then this process will be repeated 10 times. > weka.classifiers.meta.AttributeSelectedClassifier -E > ""weka.attributeSelection.CfsSubsetEval "" -S > ""weka.attributeSelection.BestFirst -D 1 -N 5"" -W > weka.classifiers.meta.CVParameterSelection -- -P ""c 2.0 512.0 10.0"" > -X 10 -S 1 -W weka.classifiers.functions.LibSVM -- -S 0 -K 2 -D 3 -G > 0.0 -R 0.0 -N 0.5 -M 40.0 -C 1.0 -E 0.0010 -P 0.1 The C parameter of LibSVM is upper-case, not lower case.

RFC 4407 is a fine summary of a key aspect in RFC 2822, but not directly related to IP-based decisions (apart from PRA uses in RFC 4406, where IPs enter the picture).  In a ""prior work"" section about IP based decisions the ASRG DNSBL draft could be also referenced. For really historical ""prior art"" I'd expect a note about RFC 4870 (some comments on slashdot are very far off the track wrt Domainkeys).  If the ""Date:"" shown in an RFC 4870 example is a real DK example,  then Domainkeys is older than SenderID, for what's it worth (IMO the age is irrelevant - ignoring the needs of patent trolls). Section 3.2.2 says that OpenPGP modifies the body of an email.  Is that still necessarily the case ? 4.4: | Typically, verification will be done by an agent | in the Administrative Management Domain (ADMD) of | the message recipient. As recipient of mails to mailboxes in various ADMDs I doubt that this is ""untypical"".  One disadvantage of the term ADMD is that it is too fine grained for many ""typical"" scenarios.  Section 5 uses ""relaying or delivering ADMD"", that is better for cases where this job is done by only one ADMD (no third parties with their own ADMDs involved). The ""ADMD"" problems could be eliminated by adopting the terms MON and MRN, sometimes fuzzier is better. Identifying MSA and MON is fine.  But for a similar attempt wrt MDA and MRN the SMTP folks hit me hard with their Bat books:  Where you write ""MDA"" it is the ""final delivery MTA"" as noted in RFC 2821, not some ""local mail"" MDA behind SMTP.   Please check the MDA definition with Eric (or in the Bat book), admittedly I got that wrong for some years... :-( 5.6: | the authoring organization's outbound service and | the receiving organization's inbound service, Talking about ADMDs the more interesting cases are services (plural), one service is straight forward. | A Mediator, such as a mailing list, often can | re-post a message without breaking the DKIM | signature. In theory it *can* do that always, but the problem is that it might be often not the case in practice. The overview document should mention such issues - at the moment it sounds more like a commercial for DKIM and reputation services than a potential RFC. The OpenPGP 2440bis draft is now RFC 4880.  RFC 4870 is listed, but not referenced in the text.  Curious folks are likely also interested in the ""IM"" part of the ""DKIM"" history, not only the RFC 4870 ""DK"" part. When you use email-arch terms ""mediator"" and ""ADMD"" just reference the corresponding I-D.  If there are slight differences between A.1 and email-arch ADMDs you got me (= I didn't check it).

In response to   concerns expressed about the verifier handling implied by the   ""discardable"" assertion, by Steve Atkins, an author of a similar draft   that coined the term: ""Domains that do not [wish] to suffer a reduction in delivery   integrity are not candidates for use of any variant of SSP (and, as   such, their needs are out of scope)."" See: http://mipassoc.org/pipermail/ietf-dkim/2008q1/009390.html http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-levine-asp-00 It is far too soon to establish (or even suggest) discarding as a   handling practice for DKIM signature failures.  Discarding invalid   signature early on will prolong incompatibility issues.  In this case,   discarding messages also eliminates evidence of possible criminal   activity, which is counter to an effort at eliminating this type of   fraud. http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02 3.3.

NON-NORMATIVE DISCUSSION:  Sender signing practices of    ""discardable"" would be usually inappropriate for domains of end    users, because of the potential for mailing lists and similar    agents to modify messages in such a way as to render the    signature invalid.  Domains sending mail that is expected to    pass with no significant modification to the recipient, such as    domains sending only transactional messages, are appropriate    places to consider the publication of a ""discardable"" practice.    See [RFC5016] section 5.3 and Appendix A for further    discussion. To eliminate concerns related to possible mishandling of the message   and to eliminate a reduction in the integrity of delivery assurances,   the term ""discardable"" needs to be changed. Change to or add: sole:   All mail from the domain is signed with an intent to   avoid agents that may damage or remove their signatures.

For an informative reference an I-D could be good enough. You have a reference to the Authentication-Results I-D.

SSP Record  Syntax: 3.3.  SSP Record Syntax   SSP Records MUST match the ""tag-list"" syntax defined in [RFC4871].   The specific tags used in SSP records are described below.   Unrecognized tags MUST be ignored.   dkim=  Outbound signing practices for the domain (plain-text;          REQUIRED).  Possible values are as follows:      unknown         Any domain may sign none, some, or all email.         The lack of a SSP record signifies an unknown policy which         allows any domain to sign mail on behalf of the Author domain.         There is no DKIM protocol consistency check for this         unknown policy.      optional         Only the Author Domain may sign none, some, or all email.         This policy is different from the default dkim=unknown policy         which allows for any domain to sign. The dkim=optional         policy is an optional Author Domain only signing practice.         The existence of a 3rd party signature contradicts the DKIM         protocol consistency of this explicit domain policy and         therefore the message SHOULD be rejected without prejudice.      all         All mail from the domain is signed by any domain.         A no signature message contradicts the DKIM protocol         consistency of this explicit domain policy and therefore the         message SHOULD be rejected without prejudice.      Discardable         All mail from the domain is signed with an Author Signature.         Furthermore, if a message arrives without a valid Author         Signature due to modification in transit, submission via a path         without access to a signing key, or other reason, the verifier         MUST reject the message without prejudice. --  Sincerely Hector Santos, CTO http://www.santronics.com http://santronics.blogspot.com ------------------------------ >From mwbfbfl@santronics.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:27 2008 Message: 8 Date: Mon, 11 Feb 2008 20:07:11 -0500 From: Hector Santos  Subject: [ietf-dkim] NEW ISSUE: Security Threats are well defined To: gfky-hddl@mipassoc.org Message-ID: <47B0F13F.7070008@santronics.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed Section 5 is pretty clear about security threat potentials about removed  all considerations in SSP-02 to deal with them. | 5.  Security Considerations | |   Security considerations in the Sender Signing Practices are mostly |   related to attempts on the part of malicious senders to represent |   themselves as other authors, often in an attempt to defraud either |   the recipient or an Alleged Author. | |   Additional security considerations regarding Sender Signing |   Practices may be found in the DKIM threat analysis [RFC4686]. | |      *<<>>* I suggest the following be added in part or in whole to the section:    There are clear and present danger with high potential frauds which    SHOULD NOT be ignored if we are to gain any payoff or add-valued    secured benefit for signers, verifiers and users:    The fraud are exhibit when transactions contradict the following    domain expectations:      o NO MAIL EXPECTED      o OPTIONAL 1ST PARTY SIGNING ONLY      o STRICT 1ST PARTY SIGNING ONLY      o 1ST OR 3rd PARTY SIGNING REQUIRED    These represent the key propositions in the protocol consistency of    the DKIM model and they can offer immediate and high potential    security protection against current legacy domain forge abuses and    expected DKIM-adapting mail abuses.    Please keep in mind that these are not signature or domain reputation    evaluators but fundamental DKIM protocol consistency checks.  It may    be viewed a ""DKIM Policy Declaration"" Checking.  In addition, there    is no verifier mandated handling requirement. All handling language    recommendations cited below are defined by RFC2119.    o NO MAIL EXPECTED      One of the largest abuse of domains are forged mail transactions      which are using RFC2822 From: domains which are not valid Email      hosting domains and/or were not expected to be used for email      transaction by the principal owner of the domain.      Protection is offered in SSP-02 as follows:      Domains can implicitly state mail is not expected by creating a NULL      public key to force invalidation of a signature. Augmenting this      with a DKIM=DISCARDABLE enforces the requirement of a valid      signature, therefore with the lack of valid signature, the message      SHOULD be rejected without prejudice.    o OPTIONAL 1ST PARTY SIGNING ONLY      Conventional wisdom suggest that domain explorers of DKIM      will test the waters using an optional 1st party signing      policy.  Some messages will be signed while others are not,      but they don't expect 3rd party signers to ""test"" the waters      for domain.      Unexpected 3rd party signing protection is not offered via SSP-02.      A new explicit policy DKIM=OPTIONAL is recommended that      distinguishes itself from the current DKIM=UNKNOWN which allows      anyone to sign and misrepresent the domain.      DKIM=OPTIONAL (NEW)      This policy declares the domain signing practices are optional, but      only expect its own domain to sign the mail.  No other 3rd party      representation is expected.  A message containing a 3rd party      signature SHOULD be rejected without prejudice.    o STRICT 1ST PARTY SIGNING ONLY      This protection is offered using DKIM=DISCARDABLE. A message with no      signature or containing a 3rd party signature SHOULD be rejected      without prejudice.    o 1ST OR 3rd PARTY SIGNING REQUIRED      A weak protection is offered using DKIM=ALL. It is weak because it      allows for an inconsistent state to exist without prejudice and      lacks handling semantics for the detectable inconsistent DKIM=ALL      policy transaction. A message with no signature or containing a 3rd      party signature MAY be rejected without prejudice. --  Sincerely Hector Santos, CTO http://www.santronics.com http://santronics.blogspot.com ------------------------------ >From mwbfbfl@santronics.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:27 2008 Message: 9 Date: Mon, 11 Feb 2008 20:07:20 -0500 From: Hector Santos  Subject: [ietf-dkim] NEW ISSUE: Security Threat: Unexpected Third 	Party	Senders To: gfky-hddl@mipassoc.org Message-ID: <47B0F148.90409@santronics.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed | A.4.  Third Party Senders | |   Another common use case is for a third party to enter into an |   agreement whereby that third party will send bulk or other mail on |   behalf of a designated author domain, using that domain in the |   RFC2822 From:  or other headers.

The authors anticipate that |   as mail systems gain experience with DKIM, it will become |   possible to codify best practices of this and other usages |   of DKIM. The fallacy in the ""common use case"" opinion stated above is that it has  limited insight and is based on the idea that a most domains may wish to  be part of a 3rd party Bulk mailer system or will part of a prior 3rd  party agreement or have a inherent TOS with 3rd party signers. Besides the obvious security fact this introduces a security threat of email forgery and mis-representation, the reality is such that a majority of the domains on the internet will not intend to participate in such 3rd party agreements nor do not wish to have any represented by 3rd party signers in any shape or form, regardless of good or bad intentions of the 3rd party. The exclusion of 3rd party restrictions makes it possible for ANY domain to be abused by 3rd party mis-representation. Proposed change:   A.4.  Third Party Senders     Another common use case is for a third party to enter into an     agreement whereby that third party will send bulk or other mail on     behalf of a designated author domain, using that domain in the     RFC2822 From:  or other headers.     However, this common use case has the potential to open a security     hole with 3rd party DKIM signers misrepresentation of domains.     To secure against this potential security threat, if the RFC2822     From: domain contains any the following SSP policies, the receiver     SHOULD honor these policy semantics:     DKIM=DISCARDABLE     DKIM=OPTIONAL         DKIM=DISCARDABLE is a 1st party only signing requirement and         DKIM=OPTIONAL is a 1st party only signing option.         No 3rd party signer is expected for these policies,         therefore, a message containing  a 3rd party signature will         be a contradiction of the explicit domain signing practice.         With these policies, the Author         Domain is informing the receiver the message SHOULD be         not be acceptable for user delivery and they do not intend         to take any responsibility for any harm caused by accepting         this unexpected representation of their domain. It MAY be         rejected without prejudice.     In lieu of the above explicit SSP policies, due to the unknown models     available for valid 3rd party arrangements, these unknowns models     SHOULD be passed to future 3rd party signing Evaluators. --  Sincerely Hector Santos, CTO http://www.santronics.com http://santronics.blogspot.com ------------------------------ >From udcat@mail-abuse.org  Sun Feb 24 10:27:27 2008 Message: 10 Date: Mon, 11 Feb 2008 18:16:37 -0800 From: Douglas Otis  Subject: [ietf-dkim] ISSUE: SSP-02:Author Signature scope too narrow 	(Updates ISSUE 1519) To: DKIM List  Cc: Barry Leiba  Message-ID: <21B1C88F-82D0-4E8B-BEE8-79E61712E59B@mail-abuse.org> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed; delsp=yes See: https://rt.psg.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1519 SSP-02: 2.8. Author Signature (too restrictive)   An ""Author Signature"" is any Valid Signature where the identity of   the user or agent on behalf of which the message is signed (listed in   the ""i="" tag or its default value from the ""d="" tag) matches an   Author Address in the message. The structure of the draft has changed for both all and strict.  In   reviewing the draft, the definition used in ASP-00 provides a far less   problematic Author Signature definition. See: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-levine-asp-00 2.8. Author Signature (too simple)   An ""Author Signature"" is any Valid Signature where the signing domain   (listed in the ""i="" tag if present, otherwise its default value,   consisting of the value of the ""d="" tag) matches the domain of an   Author Address. While the ASP definition is much better than the current SSP   definition, other definitions can better recognize the signing domain   as being authoritative for what messages are compliant with their   signing policy.  The increased scope would allow greater freedom for   domains that partition users into separate sub-domains where different   policies are asserted.  When the From email-address domain applies a   signature to the message, this indicates the message is compliant with   their signing policies.  There might be a desire to limit the scope of   this compliance to assure the scope of the signatures compliance is   constrained by the key's g= and t= parameters such that the key being   referenced could have been used for the Author Address as well. 2.8. Author Signature Full scope Author Signature definition: (recommended)   An ""Author Signature"" is any Valid Signature where the signing domain   (listed in the ""d="" tag) matches or is above the domain of the   Author Address. NON-NORMATIVE DISCUSSION: This definition permits signatures for local-part restricted keys and sub-domain restricted keys to be compliant with an assertion that all messages are signed.  The key restrictions limit the domain's authority to indicate for whom the signature was added (listed the ""i="" tag). Limited scope Author Signature definition: (conservative)   An ""Author Signature"" is any Valid Signature where the signing domain   (listed in the ""d="" tag) matches or is above the domain of the   Author Address.  The Author Address must also be contained within the   scope of the key local-part and sub-domain range (listed in the   key's ""g="" and ""t="" tags). NON-NORMATIVE DISCUSSION: The key restrictions limit the domain's authority to indicate for whom the signature was added (listed the ""i="" tag) as well as limit the ability of restricted keys to be automatically considered compliant with the domain's signing polices. -Doug ------------------------------ >From udcat@mail-abuse.org  Sun Feb 24 10:27:27 2008 Message: 11 Date: Mon, 11 Feb 2008 19:24:29 -0800 From: Douglas Otis  Subject: [ietf-dkim] ISSUE: SSP-02: MX Record publishing mandate to 	reduce	DNS overhead for SSP Discovery and to detect fraudulent 	messages To: DKIM List  Cc: Barry Leiba  Message-ID: <93EE93E3-AD8D-4FA6-9F5F-336F49050A64@mail-abuse.org> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed; delsp=yes To better ensure the minimum number of DNS transactions occur while   processing DNS SSP and key TXT records, especially for domains that do   not implement email, the SSP draft should mandate publishing MX   records whenever an SSP record is also published.  Since the SSP   discovery process makes use of MX record queries to determine whether   the domain exists, then when an SSP record is returned for a domain   that has not published an MX record, this thereby signals that both   email and DKIM are NOT used for email addresses at this domain.  This   strategy affords a better cache hit rate during the SSP discovery   process, the detection of fraudulent uses of the domain, and a means   to protect second level domains. 3.2.2.

This query MAY be done in parallel with the query made in step 2. If the result of this query is an ""NXDOMAIN"" error, the SSP Checker MUST return an appropriate error to the Evaluator and terminate the algorithm.  When the SSP record is returned without there also being an MX record at the Author Domain, the signature SHOULD BE considered fraudulent without further DNS transactions being attempted. Item 2 Was: 2.  _Verify Domain Exists._ The SSP Checker MUST perform a DNS query   for a record corresponding to the Author Domain (with no prefix).   The type of the query can be of any type, since this step is only   to determine if the domain itself exists in DNS.

Furthermore, if a message arrives without a valid        Author Signature due to modification in transit, submission via        a path without access to a signing key, or other reason, the        domain encourages the recipient(s) to discard it.                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ As it reads, the recepient(s) A.K.A END USER(S) will do the discarding  (whatever that means).

Up until Jan 11, false positives averaged about 10% of the hits and I can live with that. I noticed a surprising change on Jan 11, 2008.  Before that day many of the hits were on low scoring (< 20) spam which was very helpful.  And I would see many of these every day.  Since Jan 10 I've only seen 4 messages that hit on low scoring spam and the rest on very high scoring spam.  I don't get anymore FPs but as the spam scores for these messages are already through the roof, at the moment, the usefulness of the current rule sets have diminished.  Though I assume the methods for creating the rules are still under development and am looking forward to more improvements. Was there a big change in the way rules were created around that time period? Thanks for the great work! Nedry",0,0,social_media,social_media,social_media

*/Overview/*

With the rise of the digital workplace, email has become a ubiquitous 
tool in the office and a primary means of communication. Email's growth 
has created new opportunities and challenges for a large variety of 
artificial intelligence research, focusing an increasing amount of 
academic and industrial research on email issues. Research seeks to 
enhance the email user experience by addressing email overload or to 
learn from email social patterns. Recent papers have dealt with email 
triage, activity management, email prioritization, summarization, topic 
tracking, sorting, leak detection, social network analysis, and enhanced 
intelligent interfaces. The Workshop on Enhanced Messaging at AAAI 2008 
brings together researchers working on solutions for email and other 
forms of web messaging from many subfields of AI as well as soliciting 
participation from the broader community.


*/Workshop Goals/*

* Bring together a wide spectrum of researchers working on email and 
other messaging technologies.

* Present new and novel areas of research on important problems in the 
field.

* Encourage research that brings together multi-disciplinary techniques.

* Facilitate discussion between participants on significant challenges 
in messaging research.

* Highlight new research and production messaging systems that employ 
novel research technologies.

* Set a multi-year agenda of important research goals for the field.


*/Topics of Interest/*

* User Studies: email in the workplace, usage patterns, behaviors, email 
triage, overload

* User Interfaces: visualizations, messaging in support of user 
activities, mashups, personal information

management (PIM)

* Information Retrieval: message and thread summarization, search, 
expert finding

* Machine Learning and Data Mining: applications of ML/DM to email, 
including information extraction,

clustering, entity disambiguation, feature selection and dimensionality 
reduction for message classification

* Message Organization: automatic foldering, categorization, advanced 
calendaring and scheduling, activity

management and discovery

* Social Networks: relationship modeling, network analysis, group and 
role discovery, online communities,

people tagging

* Natural Language Processing: applications of NLP technologies to 
email, message understanding, topic

detection and tracking, sentiment/discourse/opinion analysis, dialog 
analysis, topic modeling

* Messaging Interactions on the Web: instant messaging (SMS), RSS feeds, 
blogging, tagging


Authors are invited to submit papers on these topics and we especially 
encourage cross-disciplinary work. We welcome three different submission 
types.


Full Papers (6 pages) - A full paper describes mature work, which may 
already have been published in previous conferences. A selected number 
of these papers will be selected for oral presentation during the main 
workshop session. All accepted papers will be included in the workshop 
poster session.


Extended Abstracts (2 pages) - These papers describe new and preliminary 
work. Accepted papers will be included in the workshop poster session.


Demonstration Papers (2 pages) - Since the goal of this research is to 
develop novel and interesting applications, we encourage submissions 
describing demonstration systems. Authors of accepted demonstration 
papers should expect to demonstrate their system during the workshop 
poster session.


All questions regarding the workshop should be directed to 
enhancedmessagingworkshop@gmail.com.


*/Important Dates/*

* Submissions Due: April 7, 2008

* Notifications: April 21, 2008

* Final Papers Due: May 5, 2008

I had my DS five years ago and  developed a leak which required a second surgery three days later.   I also ended up in the ICU for a week on a ventilator and problems  with fluid balance.  But the good news is I survived and recovered.  Assuming Scott's problem was caused by a leak too, he may be looking  at a lengthy recovery.  When they did the second surgery they  couldn't entirely stop the leak.  So I ended up with a drain and a  feeding tube for four months with nothing by mouth except a few ice  chips until the leak dried up.  I was told this is happens  frequently because when they go back in for the second surgery the  tissues are inflamed and don't want to bond back together again.   I also got a wound infection out the the second surgery that took 7  months to heal.  Again, this is not uncommon because your own skin  bacteria tends to infect you.   I wish Scott the best in his recovery but don't be surprized if it  takes months to regain his strength and get over the infections.

It was a long day without a lot of  progress. He is still in ICU and on the ventilator. He was able get  off of the medication they needed to use to keep his blood pressure  up which is a good sign. He is unable to speak with the ventilator  right now but he is aware and tries to write us little notes to ask  for what he needs. Right before I left today he asked me to bring  the laptop tomorrow. I'm sure how well that is going to work because  he is not too very lucid but I at the very least I can read him  everyone's get well wishes. Thank you so much for all your prayers  and get well thoughts. I really appreciate it and I know Scott does  too.  >  >   >  > [Non-text portions of this message have been removed] >           Back to top                       Reply to sender  |                        Reply to group  |                        Reply via web post               Messages in this topic             (5)                     1d.

I mean, is this condition actually debilitating?   Research shows that the physical size of the brain has nothing to do with your mental acuity, but rather, it is the health and number of interconnections that makes the difference. So in other words, if your brain was physically reducing in volume, but the complex web of electronic connectors was otherwise unharmed, then there is no problem. The only neurological function that I've heard of being affected by surgery has usually related directly back to severe B12 deficiency, which doesn't change the size of the brain, but rather hurts nerve connections. ~Melissa from Michigan~           Back to top                       Reply to sender  |                        Reply to group  |                        Reply via web post               Messages in this topic             (8)                     2b.

In the course of trying to figure out what the heck was going on with my Mom during her illness there were numerous CT scans, MRI's, and eventually a PET scan that were ordered.  The thing that was so remarkable to all of the health care professionals in her care was the marked atrophy that was seen from one diagnostic to the next. It is possible to have brain damage if your B vitamins become too low.  I've known a couple of RNY post-ops who tried to drill into my head when I was a newbie that *I* needed to supplement B vites, too - even if I was a DS post-op.  I didn't believe them, though - the current thought at that juncture was that DS'ers didn't need to worry about it.  Of course, that's total bunk.  We don't get as depleted as quickly as RNY post-ops - but we certainly do lose our stores over time.

He has developed pnumonia and has an abcess in his abdomen that will need to be  drained, which will hopefully happen tomorrow. It is right below his lungs behind his spleen and intestines. They are hoping to be able to insert a drain without another surgery but if they can't get a clear path to the abcess they will need to open him up again for yet third surgery  in a week. He is very tired and frustrated when he is awake but he being somewhat sedated to help keep him more comfortable. It looks like the next few days will continue to be this nightmare roller coaster ride. Thank you everyone so much for all your thoughts, prayers and support.

Unfortunately I do not  have good news to report today. Scott very, very sick. He has developed pnumonia and has an abcess in his abdomen that will need to be  drained, which will hopefully happen tomorrow. It is right below his lungs behind his spleen and intestines. They are hoping to be able to insert a drain without another surgery but if they can't get a clear path to the abcess they will need to open him up again for yet third surgery  in a week. He is very tired and frustrated when he is awake but he being somewhat sedated to help keep him more comfortable. It looks like the next few days will continue to be this nightmare roller coaster ride. Thank you everyone so much for all your thoughts, prayers and support. I don't know what I would do with out you.

SOAP::Data->name('radius')->type('float')- >value($serialize[16]) 		); 		push @ra, SOAP::Data->name('item'=>[@r])- >type('item'); 	} 	# sort array 	my @rb = sort { mysortfunc($a) <=> mysortfunc($b} @ra; 	return SOAP::Data->name(""result"" => \\SOAP::Data->value( 		SOAP::Data->name(""item"" => @ra)->type(""item"")) 		)->type(""items""); 	... sub mysortfunc { 	my @r = shift;  	... 	return @r; } Beacuse I need to use brackets [@r] to produce valid structure, but I  can not get access to the item. First is an array, then SOAP::Data hash, then array, then SOAP::Data  hash and then just arrays.

No Way! Signers and SSP publishers CANNOT dictate who else may or may not add   signatures as the message propagates further. It is just not the business   of SSP to state that. List expanders, for example, can be expected to add   their signatures as a matter of routine. If what you are trying to say is what signers to whom you have outsourced   your mail sending may or may not do (which is one - but only one - meaning   of ""3rd party signing""), then that is fine, but that is NOT what you have   written What SSP CAN do is to state how subsequent signatures are to be handled by   checkers/evaluators/verifiers/whatever. For example, the true effect of the ""Discardable"" option is to tell   verifiers that ""we recommend you to ignore any signatures other that our   own when deciding how to dispose of these messages"". In fact, the   semantics of ""Discardable"" should probably be specified in that way. --  Charles�H.�Lindsey�---------At�Home,�doing�my�own�thing------------------------ Tel:�+44�161�436�6131�                       ���Web:�http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~chl Email:�wyz@clerew.man.ac.uk������Snail:�5�Clerewood�Ave,�CHEADLE,�SK8�3JU,�U.K. PGP:�2C15F1A9������Fingerprint:�73�6D�C2�51�93�A0�01�E7�65�E8�64�7E�14�A4�AB�A5 ------------------------------ >From wyz@clerew.man.ac.uk  Sun Feb 24 10:27:26 2008 Message: 3 Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2008 11:28:21 -0000 From: ""Charles Lindsey""  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] ISSUE: SSP-02:Author Signature scope too 	narrow	(Updates ISSUE 1519) To: DKIM  Message-ID:  Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed; delsp=yes; charset=iso-8859-1 On Tue, 12 Feb 2008 02:16:37 -0000, Douglas Otis    wrote: > Limited scope Author Signature definition: (conservative) > >   An ""Author Signature"" is any Valid Signature where the signing domain >   (listed in the ""d="" tag) matches or is above the domain of the >   Author Address.

Yes, that is the only definition that is really correct, though the   wording might well be improved.     An ""Author Signature"" is any Valid Signature where the domain of the     Author Address is a sub-domain of the signing domain     (listed in the ""d="" tag). Morover, the  of the Author   Address     must also be contained within the scope of the key local-part of any   ""g=""     tag. Having just reread the relevant bits of RFC 4871, I cannot see what effect   a tag ""t=s"" would have, since it just restricts what the domain of the   ""i="" tag may be, but that domain appears to play no part in the   verification process. In fact, ISTM that sections 3.5 and 3.8 contradict   each other. Perhaps someone could enlighten me on this. --  Charles�H.�Lindsey�---------At�Home,�doing�my�own�thing------------------------ Tel:�+44�161�436�6131�                       ���Web:�http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~chl Email:�wyz@clerew.man.ac.uk������Snail:�5�Clerewood�Ave,�CHEADLE,�SK8�3JU,�U.K. PGP:�2C15F1A9������Fingerprint:�73�6D�C2�51�93�A0�01�E7�65�E8�64�7E�14�A4�AB�A5 ------------------------------ >From vvrpgs@porcupine.org  Sun Feb 24 10:27:26 2008 Message: 4 Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2008 10:23:01 -0500 (EST) From: vvrpgs@porcupine.org (Wietse Venema) Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] ISSUE: SSP-02: MX Record publishing mandate 	to reduce	DNS overhead for SSP Discovery and to detect fraudulent 	messages To: gfky-hddl@mipassoc.org Message-ID: <20080212152301.8AD931F3E99@spike.porcupine.org> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII Douglas Otis: > To better ensure the minimum number of DNS transactions occur while   > processing DNS SSP and key TXT records, especially for domains that do   > not implement email, the SSP draft should mandate publishing MX   > records whenever an SSP record is also published.

Per the draft, an NXDOMAIN reply for an Author domain lookup already terminates the SSP algorithm with ""failure"". This is good enough. DKIM and SSP are not appropriate vehicles for making other records mandatory where now they are not. > When the SSP record is returned without there also being > an MX record at the Author Domain, the signature SHOULD BE considered > fraudulent without further DNS transactions being attempted. _1.  I oppose the re-introduction of ""suspicious"", ""fraudulent"", etc. Those are overly-specific interpretations of failures that will more often than not have non-malicious causes.

MX records are not required for (2)821(bis) interoperability, and RFC 2119 has a very clear policy about arbitrary MUSTard. > Since the SSP discovery process makes use of MX record > queries to determine whether the domain exists It could as well use A, AAAA, NS, TXR, RP (FWIW), etc.  AFAIK it uses MX because that might be also used (i.e. cached) for other tasks of the MTA.  > then when an SSP record is returned for a domain that has  > not published an MX record, this thereby signals that both   > email and DKIM are NOT used for email addresses If there are no mail authors in this domain a statement that these mails from the ""non-existing"" authors is always signed suffices to reject unsigned mails from these ""non-existing"" authors.  For a domain without users this is a no-brainer, and unrelated to the non-existence of MX records.   For a domain with existing users who are not ""permitted"" to be mail authors removing any MX records does not suffice to  educate stubborn users.   DKIM by design does not depend on SMTP.  Your proposal mixes unrelated layers.  I like your general MX idea, but is is no SSP ""feature"".

The term is MAIL FROM (46 occurences in RFC 4408).  IMO ""suspicious"" was better than ""discardable"".  The 2821bis terms for ""discard"" is ""drop"", adding tons of caveats, without noting non-technical facts, e.g., ""dropping mail"" can violate the ""constitution"" (or base law)  where I live, and that is not on the same level as ordinary crimes.

Is the issue that you don't like the semantics SSP implies, or that you'd prefer we were more circumspect about describing them? They'd both be valid concerns, but they're quite different.

It has nothing to do with LIKE or DISLIKE. It simply doesn't jive with SMTP design. The only entity in email  framework that can ""safely"" discard mail without raising technical and  ""legal"" eyebrows  are end users. If your ASP design it to remove all MTA handling considerations from the  DKIM/SSP mix, then it might make sense.

Apple's dictionary- recipient: a person or thing that receives or is awarded something Per the SSP-02 abstract: DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) defines a domain-level authentication framework for email using public-key cryptography and key server technology to permit verification of the source and contents of messages by either Mail Transport Agents (MTAs) or Mail User Agents (MUAs).  The primary DKIM protocol is described in This document describes the records that authors' domains can use to advertise their practices regarding signing their outgoing mail, and how other hosts can access, parse and interpret those records. Clearly SSP is intended for use by both MUAs and MTAs.  However, discarding is _not_ appropriate at the MTA in many cases.  Message handling should be defined by a follow-on document.  One such document might be written for use at the MTA, and another at the MUA. -Doug ------------------------------ >From mwbfbfl@santronics.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:26 2008 Message: 14 Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2008 12:54:27 -0500 From: Hector Santos  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] ISSUE:  Rename SSP to ASP To: nonlmuut@bbiw.net Cc: gfky-hddl@mipassoc.org Message-ID: <47B1DD53.8000700@santronics.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed Dave Crocker wrote: > The practices that SSP describe are specific to the RFC2822 From: header  > field, which defines the author of a message.

Clearly, this is what happens when you have 2+ years of work  commandeered in less than 2 weeks (admittedly a thing of beauty in the  art of Mastering Chaos) with essentially a Find/Replace string stripped  down document (IMO borderline unethical) where you end up with  conflictive semantics all over the place. Clearly, the attempt was to remove all MTA verifiers logic for filtering  DKIM mail with the only explicit semantics provided for a MUA entity. But you also need to ask, why even have an SSP or ASP ""skeleton""  document? We already have the model of ideas in RFC 4871 and RFC 5016. At this point, I would vote for a total SSP/ASP abandonment rather than  risk the email world to such questionable late minute changes without  thinking much about the consequences. --  Sincerely Hector Santos, CTO http://www.santronics.com http://santronics.blogspot.com ------------------------------ >From vvrpgs@porcupine.org  Sun Feb 24 10:27:26 2008 Message: 17 Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2008 13:21:49 -0500 (EST) From: vvrpgs@porcupine.org (Wietse Venema) Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] ISSUE:  Rename SSP to ASP To: gfky-hddl@mipassoc.org Message-ID: <20080212182149.68FBB1F3E9C@spike.porcupine.org> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII Dave Crocker: > The practices that SSP describe are specific to the RFC2822 From: > header field, which defines the author of a message.

I agree. It's not reasonable to hold of alphas because the Windows
binaries may be released a few days later. Do we need official Windows
binaries for alphas at all? Martin's buildbot creates nightly Windows
builds. We could point users to the nightly builds and ask them to test
the version.

I guess it's less than 2 hours. You can prepare most of the work like
the announcements a couple of days earlier. I (perhaps naively) assume
you have to smack the whip to get everything in place, do the svn cp to
tag, svn export, tar cz, tar xzf && ./configure && make && make test
dance and upload the tar.gz. Am I missing something important? :]

Dunno :) But I'm probably the last in a long line of Python core
developers to get hired. Don't forget I'm still fresh and a junior core
developer. *jk*

#1569 is critical but not important enough to stop an alpha. As I said
in the other mail it should be fixed for the first beta and must be
fixed for the first rc.

Summary: atexit not called for pythonservice (win32)

Initial Comment:
I have a couple of functions registered with atexit
which work fine when the program is executed on
command-line. But when I run the same as a windows
service, and stop the service using service interface,
these hooks never get call backs. The service does exit
normally (at least my program doesn't do os._exit() and
there are no exceptions).

I am using ActiveState's distribution of python, but I
would imagine this is non-specific. Here is the version
information:

ActivePython 2.4.1 Build 247 (ActiveState Corp.) based on
Python 2.4.1 (#65, Jun 20 2005, 17:01:55) [MSC v.1310
32 bit (Intel)] on win32

As a workaround I am calling the
atexit._run_exitfuncs() manually before returning from
SvcDoRun() for now.

Just a ping - the fix here isn't obvious given we may have multiple
services in an executable.  I'm confident there are reasonable
work-arounds, so punting again (at least until we do host multiple services
in 1 .exe)

Well, I can't see how to attach files to this report, though there is a
line listing the number of attachments (listing it as 0, though).

So, the example is at http://tartarus.org/~richard/test_service.py
If I register and run the service (with ""python test_service.py start"" on
the command line), I get two log entries - one saying ""Started"" and one
saying ""Stopping"", 5 seconds later.

If I uncomment the ""sys.exitfunc()"" line, I get an extra message ""Atexit
called"", immediately after the ""Stopping"" message.

I would expect to see the ""Atexit called"" message even with the call to
""sys.exitfunc()"" commented out.

I don't have time to add Py_Finalize to PythonService.cpp and recompile,
but I would imagine that that would cause the sys.exitfunc() to be called
correctly - Py_Finalize is usually responsible for calling sys.exitfunc()
to be called on interpreter shutdown.

This issue is still present.  I have a minimal example which reproduces it
which I will attach to this bug shortly.

Note - regarding ""woodsplitter""'s comment - I don't think this is related
to the issue linked to there.  As far as I can tell, the issue there is
related to atexit being called in an order different to that expected, due
to threading issues.  In my minimal example, I have no threads involved;
all my example code runs in SvcDoRun, in a single thread.

I believe the problem is simply that, in src/PythonService.cpp,
Py_Finalize() is never called.  For example, in the main() function,
Py_Initialize() is called near the start, but a corresponding Py_Finalize()
is not called.

Doesn't seem to be. In my case I don't see a call back at
all, so the issue is not about when it gets called.

I wonder if this bug is related to the following issue?

Posted: February 11, 2008 Job title: Dynamic Voter Driven Search Engine Company name: Vision Impact LLC Location: United States, UT, Saint George  Travel: 0% Terms of employment: Independent contractor (project-based) Hours: Flexible Onsite: no Description: Big vision to start with a single county in the state of Utah (USA). The vision will allow online users to first search for any service, business etc. within their county or local area (zip code, voting precinct or the like), and add a written comment about the business with a simple thumbs up and a thumbs down tool. Users can then find the better quality business or service as defined by user themselves and not paid listings. At the top of the found search listing is the business placed their by voters. There is more vision to come in stages and must be willing to sign a non disclosure agreement. This is eventually a large project that will eventually manipulate huge amounts of text (great for Perl). Once one county is up and running with written content with up or down votes, all deciding the ranking of things, we will move to a five county area and beyond. It gets very big after this.  Required skills: Perl, as I understand, is the best for manipulating huge blocks of text. Other programing languages a plus. I am a former college English teacher turned into an entrepreneur. I am not a programer.  Desired skills: Webdevelopment, graphic design (nothing busy), and love for the job and its vision.

That would be find with me.  Where are those Windows binaries

Dunno yet!  It's been years since I did a release and I really want to

Category: pythonwin Group: None >Status: Closed >Resolution: Fixed Priority: 5 Private: No Submitted By: Tim Diggins (tdiggins) Assigned to: Nobody/Anonymous (nobody) Summary: function s not working in module-browser pane Initial Comment: As of pythonwin 157 (at least on my version on  Win2000), when you drag out the left-hand margin to  show the module-browser pane (not sure of correct  python win terminology here), the functions are no  longer displayed, nor work correctly. Instead they just display  and double clicking on them gives status  line ""Can not locate the source code for this object"". The reason for this is that pyclbr.Function used to be an  subclass of pyclbr.Class but no longer is.  Thus an attribute error is raised at the wrong point in  pywin.framework.editor.ModuleBrowser.HierListCLBRClass  (because a pyclbr.Function no longer has redundant  attributes super and methods) A way to fix this is to mirror the change and give  ModuleBrowser.HierListCLBRFunction its own __init__  and make it inherit directly from  ModuleBrowser.HierListCLBRItem. I include a file with  JUST the necessary changes (the redefinition of  ModuleBrowser.HierListCLBRFunction). best Tim ---------------------------------------------------------------------- >Comment By: Roger Upole (rupole) Date: 2008-02-26 08:00 Message: Logged In: YES  user_id=771074 Originator: NO This appears to have been fixed in ModuleBrowser.py r1.7. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Comment By: Tim Diggins (tdiggins) Date: 2003-10-17 03:37 Message: Logged In: YES  user_id=263040 Oops - this is the same as #794193.

Aaron, I appreciate your comments except when you're BS'ing just for the sake of it.  This is not the right list for a discourse on switchmode powersupply design.   In mid 1908s when I worked in electronics for s short while, a switchmode supply could achieve 80% efficiency without any major design effort.  I'm assuming that this is still possible, even with sub-standard components and designers.   > To get the 80+% efficiency across the board is NOT a trivial thing.  I have to disagree.  Even a relatively poor or inexperienced design will achieve that.  Aiming at 90% or higher is less than trivial. > You're really not qualified to advise others on this subject. Please do tell us exactly why you are qualified to judge that. /Per Jessen, Zürich --  >From dlnirllc@waikato.ac.nz  Sun Feb 24 10:30:29 2008 Message: 6 Date: Tue, 19 Feb 2008 08:35:28 +1300 From: Peter Reutemann  Subject: Re: [Wekalist] Memory independent algorithms To: ""Weka machine learning workbench list.""

No, not possible from the Explorer. Why?

My example used an environmental variable that may or may not be true.  The code to detect what dependencies the code has  will not find the module if the variable is false, but the code will still be dependent on the module if the environmental variable is set to true later.  Another simple example of this is the DBI module.  It will not load a given DBD module until a connect is called.  Consider my $dbh = DBI->connect(@ENV{qw); What DBD module does this code require?  The problem here is that you cannot be certain all of the modules for a script will be loaded at the start (or any other time for that matter) of a script if the author has decided to load them dynamically.  Hopefully the author has documented this well, but no autodetection code can be guaranteed to find it.  You might also want to look into the Halting problem* if you don't believe me.  If you solve it you can make a lot of money. * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem --  Chas.
