Sender: wblci-akz@maillist.cs.orst.edu
Precedence: bulk


Pattern recognition has long been, and continues to be, a major
component of machine intelligence and decision analysis under
uncertainty. Over the years, a large number of methods and algorithms
have been developed, ranging from perceptrons, clustering algorithms,
and Bayesian and neurofuzzy classifiers, to SVM, ART and SOM
classifiers. There is a large literature which addresses benchmarking
and performance evaluation. With this as the backdrop, what is
suggested in the following is a conceptually simple scheme which may
contribute to a better understanding of the capabilities of various
approaches. The scheme has the format of a contest which is referred
to as Pattern Recognition Contest, or PRC for short. The suggestion is
tentative and the rules are not defined precisely. Furthermore, in
contrast to conventional methods of evaluation, PRC leads to rankings
which are fuzzy rather than crisp. Fuzziness of rankings is a
reflection of the fact that in most realistic settings, evaluation of
performance does not lend itself to conclusions which are precise and
definitive.

Stated briefly, the point of departure in PRC is the assumption that
there are N+1 entrants, EO, EI, ..., EN, with EO representing a human,
H, who serves as a point of reference, and Ei, i=1, , N, representing
an algorithm. For example, E1 may be an SVM classifier or a special
version of the classifier. There is no communication between the Ei
and no coaching. I am the judge and the manager.  I chose a black and
red pattern in the unit square, S. For concreteness, the pattern may
be a 4x4 checkboard. The Ei do not know what the pattern is.

I chose a point at random in S, present it to the Ei, and ask each Ei
to tell me whether the point is black or red. If Ei guesses the color
correctly, Ei gets one dollar from me. If not, Ei pays me one
dollar. At the end of the first step, each Ei knows what the correct
answer is. Since the test sequence consists of just one point, the Ei
can do no better than toss a coin to come up with an answer.

I chose another point at random and repeat the procedure. The process
continues. As n, the number of points in the test sequence increases,
the Ei improve performance and increase earnings. The earnings are
tabulated for each value of n. The human entrant, H, is allowed to see
the emerging pattern of black and red points at each step.

At each step, n, the total earnings are tabulated for each entrant,
with r(Ei, n) representing the total earnings of Ei. The earnings
are smoothed through the use of a moving average, resulting in a
smoothed earnings sequence s(H, 1), s(H, 2), , s(H, n), and likewise
for the Ei, i=1, , N. To speed up evaluation, the tests may be
batched and their results tabulated at the end of each batch.  The
process terminates at time T when, for most entrants, the frequency
of correct answers approaches unity. At this point, we have N+1
total earnings s(H, T), s(E1, T), , s(EN, T).

Results of the contest are determined by an analysis of the pattern of
smoothed earning sequences from the beginning to the end of the
contest. Among the attributes of each sequence there are two that are
of primary importance: (a) the total earnings at the end of the test;
and (b) the length of the test sequence at the end of which the
frequency of correct answers is close to unity. This attribute may be
interpreted as an indicator of the speed of learning.

To simplify evaluation of results, the total earnings scale may be
granulated, with a granule being a labeled fuzzy set, e.g., low,
medium, high, very high, etc. Granulation is consistent with the
imprecision of definition of termination.

In analyzing earning sequences, it may be easier to employ pairwise
comparisons. In this case, AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) techniques
may be used to arrive at a granulated linear ordering or
preordering. (See T. Yamashita and Y. Yonezawa, ""Effective Use of
Fuzzy AHP for Supporting Human Decision Making,"" Journal of Japan
Society for Fuzzy Theory and Intelligent Informatics, 16(1): 26-32,
2004.)

In the case of a regular pattern, like the checkboard, it is likely
that the human entrant would be hard to beat because he/she can see
the pattern of points at each step. A tougher test would be an
irregular pattern or a distorted regular pattern.

In conclusion, what should be underscored is that the format of the
contest which is suggested in the foregoing is tentative and
informal. But the basic idea may point in the right direction. Results
of preliminary testing may be obtained from Dr. Masoud Nikravesh,

Preliminary Call for Papers

Tenth conference on
Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge
TARK X
 
June 10-12, 2005
Singapore 


Conference web page: 

http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tark05/. 


Sponsor: 

National University of Singapore


About the Conference

The mission of the TARK conferences is to bring together researchers
from a wide variety of fields, including Artificial Intelligence,
Cryptography, Distributed Computing, Economics and Game Theory,
Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology, in order to further our
understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about
rationality and knowledge. Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to, semantic models for knowledge, belief, and uncertainty,
bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning, commonsense
epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, knowledge and action,
applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states,
belief revision, and foundations of multi-agent systems. 

TARK X will occur as part of an 8-week program ""Uncertainty and
Information in Economics"", organized by the Institute for Mathematical
Sciences (IMS), National University of Singapore in the period of 9
May - 3 July 2005.  TARK X will take place in conjunction with a
workshop in the program, which is to be held on 6-10 June 2005 (see
http://www.ims.nus.edu.sg/Programs/uie/index.htm).

Submissions are now invited to TARK-X.  Strong preference will be
given to papers whose topic is of interest to an interdisciplinary
audience, and papers should be accessible to such an audience. Papers
will be held to the usual high standards of research publications. In
particular, they should 1) contain enough information to enable the
program committee to identify the main contribution of the work; 2)
explain the significance of the work -- its novelty and its practical
or theoretical implications; and 3) include comparisons with and
references to relevant literature. For submission method, please refer
to the conference web page http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tark05/.

Abstracts should be no longer than ten double-spaced pages (4,000
words). Optional technical details such as proofs may be included in
an appendix. An email address for the contact author should be
included. Papers arriving late or departing significantly from these
guidelines risk immediate rejection.  Papers arriving late or
departing significantly from these guidelines risk immediate
rejection.  One author of each accepted paper will be expected to
present the paper at the conference.

Economists should be aware that special arrangements have been made
with certain economics journals (in particular, with International
Journal of Game Theory, Games and Economic Behavior, Journal of
Economic Theory, Econometrica, Theory and Decision, and Mathematical
Social Sciences) so that publication of an extended abstract in TARK
will not prejudice publication of a full journal version.

The registration fee for the conference will be low, with an additional
reduction for students.  The participants will be offered a room
in a 4* hotel at a special price not exceeding 90 US$ per day.

	     CHALLENGES TO DECISION SUPPORT IN A CHANGING WORLD


		Submission Deadline: October 27, 2004


One of the most daunting challenges faced by decision support systems
is a perpetual change in their environment. Existing decision support
methodologies, tools, and frameworks are often difficult to scale up
and adapt to changing knowledge, work-flow, and operational setting.
Successful decision support systems need to fulfill the following
three requirements in their design and implementation: First, the
representation and reasoning techniques need to incrementally
incorporate new subject matter knowledge along with new methods for
information integration, organization, monitoring, and analysis.
Second, the systems need to adjust to changing policies, regulations,
standards, evolving operating procedures, different decision makers
and target groups, and diverse operational settings.  Third, the
systems need to effectively operate in a distributed infrastructure,
built on heterogeneous and evolving computing and networking
platforms.

Adaptive Systems that have to cope with change need to include
methodologies that go outside single theories. For example, systems
that are based on probabilistic or decision-theoretic principles will
be typically unable to cope with change by themselves, as neither
probability theory nor decision theory say much about how decision
models are constructed, let alone how they should be modified. The
general AI concepts of perception, learning, control, abstraction, and
personalization must be inherently designed into the methodological,
architectural, and operational aspects of adaptive systems, from
application design through software and hardware infrastructure
support.

This symposium aims at bringing together researchers with experience
or interest in building adaptive decision support systems. Since some
domains, such as biomedicine, deal with numerous modes of reasoning,
this symposium aims at providing a coherent forum that will highlight
various issues involved and will facilitate cross-disciplinary
diffusion of methods in reasoning about and adapting to change. The
central themes for the symposium are: (1) Practical fielding of
adaptive decision support systems, and (2) Crucial technologies for
successful adaptive decision support systems. We encourage submissions
that address (but are not limited to) relevant issues in the domains
of biomedicine, finance and business, and military/government/homeland
security. In particular, we welcome submissions that address the
challenges faced and the solutions involved, what worked, what did
not, and why. We also welcome contributions that chart out new
research agendas and identify specific crucial issues.

SUBMISSION INFORMATION

The symposium will consist of formal paper presentations, as well as
interdisciplinary panel and discussion sessions. Potential
participants are invited to submit either a 6-page full paper (5,000
words maximum) or a 1-2 page extended abstract (1,500 words maximum)
outlining their relevant research activities and how they see their
contribution to the symposium. Please submit papers in PDF format to

And my point is that in contrast to some of the other opinions, I don't
believe there is any such thing as a ""correct"" value. I think it's
deployment-specific.

To use one perhaps contrived example, using a certificate is prone to
caching a user's PIN. So what's the right timestamp? The last time they
entered a PIN? Or every time the key is silently reused?
 
> For instance, consider an IdP that routinely sets IssueInstant and

Not IMHO. It certainly doesn't violate the spec as it stands now, at least
in core.

One reason I'd be against changing this is that I don't think it would help.
Knowing that it's illegal to do something doesn't help an SP when the IdP
gets it wrong, and I think a lot would get it wrong. I think it's better to
be clear that the SP should do its homework before relying on the value.

Introduction to Machine Learning
Ethem Alpaydin

The goal of machine learning is to program computers to use example
data or past experience to solve a given problem. Many successful
applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that
analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, recognize faces
or spoken speech, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be
completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from
bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a
comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of
topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. It
discusses many methods based in different fields, including
statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial
intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining, in order to
present a unified treatment of machine learning problems and
solutions. All learning algorithms are explained so that the student
can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer
program. The book can be used by advanced undergraduates and graduate
students who have completed courses in computer programming,
probability, calculus, and linear algebra. It will also be of interest
to engineers in the field who are concerned with the application of
machine learning methods.

After an introduction that defines machine learning and gives examples
of machine learning applications, the book covers supervised learning,
Bayesian decision theory, parametric methods, multivariate methods,
dimensionality reduction, clustering, nonparametric methods, decision
trees, linear discrimination, multilayer perceptrons, local models,
hidden Markov models, assessing and comparing classification
algorithms, combining multiple learners, and reinforcement learning.

The Eighth Biennial Israeli Symposium on the Foundations of Artificial 
Intelligence will be held in June 27-29, 2005 in Haifa, Israel.

We solicit papers on substantial research in all areas of Artificial 
Intelligence, including, but not limited to the following:

- foundations 
- natural language processing  
- searching 
- knowledge representation 
- automated reasoning  
- computational linguistics  
- planning 
- information retrieval  
- machine learning  
- temporal reasoning  
- robotics 
- knowledge-based systems  
- data mining  
- AI algorithms  
- intelligent agents 
- probabilistic reasoning  

Invited Speakers:
================

BISFAI 2005 will host several invited plenary speakers.

The following have been confirmed to date:

    * John McCarthy (Stanford Univ.)
    * Shlomo Zilberstein (Univ. of Massachusettes)

Submission Guidelines:
=====================

Extended abstracts should be 6-12 pages in length, including references 
and figures. Submissions should be made electronically, as attachments in 
Postscript, PDF or Word format and sent by email to Uri Schild 
. 
Submission deadline is April 8, 2005. Notification date is May 9th, 2005.
**************************************************************************

The official proceedings will be web-based and made available at the 
BISFAI website.
 
System Demonstrations:
=====================

We also solicit proposals for demonstrations of innovative applications of 
artificial intelligence, of length 1-2 pages. 
Submission deadline is April 8, 2005.
Proposals should be sent by email to Uri Schild .
 
Multiple Submissions:
====================

Papers may be submitted to BISFAI even if submitted to other conferences 
or journals, because the BISFAI website is not archival.

Previously presented or published papers are unacceptable.

Special Issue:
=============

Full versions of selected papers may be submitted after the symposium for 
possible journal publication in the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial 
Intelligence.
Of course, if a paper is accepted at an archival conference such as AAAI 
or IJCAI and also presented at BISFAI, this paper must be substantially 
revised and/or extended for consideration for journal publication.

The BISFAI-05 program and schedule will be available online. Abstracts of 
invited and accepted papers will be made available on the abstracts page, 
with pointers to online versions of the paper, when available here.
 
Student Grants:
==============

As in previous years, BISFAI hopes to be able to provide partial financial 
support to advanced research students. 
To apply, send your full CV to Dr. Claudia V. Goldman  
by April 8, 2005 along with the name of your thesis advisor or other 
faculty members to be contacted for a recommendation.
