Plelim,

Just to remind you that if a certificate is needed in a hurry it can be expedited. This process is double the cost of a normal application. The normal cost for a Trial Certificate is LOA(m)x €5.45

A customer is looking for a book that may have been written about the disappearance in June of 1972, of a young boy (Adrian McNaughton) in the Holmes' Lake area of Brougham Township in Renfrew County (Ottawa Valley area of Ontario). He was 6 years old at the time.

She recalls having seen something about it in the past (other than printed news reports. Perhaps a bound official report? An article in a magazine?).

Any information or leads (even a ""yes - there is"" or ""no - there isn't"") would be much appreciated.

Kindest regards - John Lynch.

Ah... the problem is the *

You're going to have to explicitly list all of the directories
that are on the root partition on the command line, WITHOUT
listing any mountpoints (/home, /usr, whatever)

By using *, you effectively said ""stay within ANY AND ALL of the
filesystems containing these directories"", including any
filesystem with a mountpoint in the / directory (i.e. /proc,
/dev, /home, ... )

I did, but it was a long time ago. I'll be glad to have
another look at it; I think that code needs more work
before getting mainstream use. But, it is very important,
and not overly difficult.

IIRC, I broke the v0.01 interface, but I will be happy
to discuss any of this, if anyone ever wants to use it.

Please provide informations instead of literature. I am happy that 
everything contains the right value for you, but this brings us nowhere. 
so I'll repeat myself.

- print the value of $mailbox (to logs or whatever) so that you see what 
it is.

There are many different setups out there. if the whole mailstore 
belongs to vmail, then under a standard unix, vmail can do everything in 
the mailstore.

FWIW, I had an HP dv6000 with hardware problems, and when I made the support 
call I did tell them I was running linux though I resisted any suggestions to 
try Windows and forced them to diagnose it anyways.

When I got my ticket to send it in for service, I pulled the drive altogether 
and placed a sticky on it saying ""HDD removed for corporate policy reasons"".

They fixed my system and sent it back three days later.

If you have a hardware problem, don't bother including the drive.  They can 
troubleshoot it without it, and it keeps them from sending it back 
saying ""WON'T FIX"" because you have linux on it.

Just my 2c...

KV

Sorry, must have missed this along the way - didn't see any reference to

A friend is using the Home edition and I haven't ""played"" with it 
(because I didn't want to get tangled up with Home edition :-) ) so 
cannot comment for or against that you have both Admin and user accounts 
on it. All I know is what I heard, and read (and quoted above) about the 
Home edition of XP.

Of course, it is in XP Professional that most people who use it at home 
who never get past the first account - the Administrator - and do not 
create a user with limited access rights.

The need to create a normal, limited access, user in XP Professional is 
not something which is enforced in Professional which is why, I 
understand, most XP Prof. setups are being run by a home user with full 
Admin. rights. I cannot see why the Home edition should be more security 
conscious than the Professional edition, and also cost much less, unless 
SP1 and SP2 introduced the ability to create limited-access users in the 
Home edition.

Ciao.

After you get the interface defined, I think that it should either 
become part of VMS.c or statically linked with it.

VMS.C is currently looking up and caching the values of several logical 
names.  If those logical names are changed through VMS::LOGICAL then it 
may be desirable to update the value inside of VMS.C to match.

Special care is needed with the logical names that control C features, 
as it is an alternate method of controlling behavior.

We need to find out what happens if you create a logical name to change 
a feature to be different than what it was specifically set to using the 
decc$feature_*() api, and behave the same way in VMS.C

I may need this to make the ODS-5 handling work on older versions of VMS.

I believe both versions work the same.  The first account has admin
rights and many people don't go beyond that to create users with
restricted rights.  They simply don't realize the difference between
admin and user.  At least in Linux, at least SUSE, you get warnings
about running as root and you're expected to create a user during
install.  With Ubuntu and some other distros, the first user is an admin
user, with rights to create a root password.  Additional users are mere
mortals.

No.

The problem is, that if you enable such access, your VM (virtual
machine) will no longer be isolated, so the code will leak, and it may
destroy data on your host (physical PC).
This is very unsafe.

nope, you have to upgrade between different factory snapshots ( thing

Gardai have recovered two handguns and three explosive devices during a
raid targeting INLA criminals in Dublin.

Ammunition and other paraphernalia were also found during a search of a
premises on Stanhope Street yesterday evening.

One man was arrested at the scene.

Gardai say the operation targeted Dublin-based members of the INLA with
links to organised criminals.

Fresh install on real machine went smoothly on one machine but trying to
upgrade an 11.0A1 VirtualBox install failed to upgrade even one package.
No errors occurred it just seemed to skip the part where software would
be selected.

Since KDE 4 is the default KDE version installed and it is still fairly
new there are numerous bugs that I hope are worked out before the GM
release. But then that is why I am testing on spare hardware, to help
find the bugs. It also appears that the KDE devs are taking lessons from
the gnome devs where less control is better. The number of options
available for config in the control panel is far less then what I would
expect based on past experience. This could be setup as a choice:
beginner == fewer options presented, advanced == more config options
presented.

On freshly installed machine my Logitech wheel mouse is not recognized.
Even after adding the appropriate info in xorg.conf.

Re-sizing any window larger in the KDE desktop requires a click in the
missing portion to make it visible.

Launching KDE apps from the menu (or via alt-f2 popup) causes a SIGSEGV
error to pop up but they run from the command line.

More info (and bug reports opened) as I continue to test.

Bottom line: keep up the great work as I think this will end up as a
very good version, not great (because of the KDE4 bugs that will
persist. But that is to be expected when you have a major UI change.

While I did not have a live DVD of 10.3 on hand, I did have the regular install DVD. Since I had

original root partition and copied the kernel files there and update grub's menu.lst. The machine
booted fine and I did a kernel update to the ""fixed"" kernel and things are back to normal again.

One thing I have noticed, is any time I install a release of (open)SUSE alongside another one,
so that I have multiple versions installed,  grub is installed again and I have all these grubs pointing to
other installations or other grubs on the various partitions. I can clean it all up after the installations

I always keep a second small installation in a separate partition, for 
emergencies.

Better let each install do it's own grub into its root or boot partition, 
not the mbr. That way they don't collide.

YaST --> Software Management --> Search: apt

The problem is where to find software in format that apt understands. 
So far I know, there is no new versions in apt repositories, ie. it seems

no, but you can achieve that by using restriction classes.

If the check you run is at the end of a restriction ""set"", and is simple 
enough (no map lookup in particular), you can simply order the checks 
such as in
    # checks for some clients
    check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/foo_access
    ... [checks for other clients]

== foo_access:
unknown      do_this, do_that, permit

I have XP Pro at home.  How do I access the Administrator account, so that
I can unzip some files that have been sent to me?  AFAIR, the install did not
ask me for a password, so I don't have one--that I know of.  What an idiot 
system!

Per,

	I will be watching because as I already posted I see the ""exact"" same 
instability problems with my:

Gigabyte GA-N700SL
2 Gig of Ram
Raid1: 2 Seagate (ST3250410AS_6RY28WW1) SATA 250G drives in Raid 1
ATA: Maxtor_5T020H2_T2H34J2 as swap

	I mean the *exact* same problems. Please do not forget to post any 
response you get from them. It also may be a kernel issue. Take a look 
at another bug I have open regarding this instability. The fact that it 
has spamassassin involved may be irrelevant. A Gigabyte,kernel issue may 
be the root cause:

  Locate a copy of jhylafax, and install this.  You will have a GUI
front end for sending faxes.  Note, the version that I have does not
auto update the send state of the fax, and with the modem speaker turned
off you will not really know if your phone line is free.  BTW there is
KdeprintFax  (kdeprintfax -caption ""%c"" %i %m %u -- on the command

SpamBayes 1.1a4 (the fourth alpha release) is out.  You can download it from
SourceForge: .  This is currently a
source only release.  There is as yet no Outlook installer.

What's New in 1.1a4?
====================

Version 1.1a4 introduces a new application, core_server.py.  This
application is tailored to provide spam filtering by non-mail applications
such as Trac, Roundup, MoinMoin or your favorite blogging server.  The
external interface is XML-RPC.  It also implements a plugin architecture so
new protocol adapters can be added easily.

What is SpamBayes?
==================

The SpamBayes project is working on developing a statistical (commonly,
although a little inaccurately, referred to as Bayesian) anti-spam filter,
initially based on the work of Paul Graham. The major difference between
this and other, similar projects is the emphasis on testing newer approaches
to scoring messages. While most anti-spam projects are still working with
the original graham algorithm, we found that a number of alternate methods
yielded a more useful response.

SpamBayes is not a single application. The core code is a message
classifier, however there are several applications available as part of the
SpamBayes project which use the classifier in specific contexts. For the
most part, the current crop of applications all operate on the client side
of things, however, a number of people have experimented with using
SpamBayes on mail servers to classify incoming mail for multiple users.

Contact, Help & Feedback
========================

Please take the new alpha release out for a spin around the block.  Report
any feedback or problems you have with the new functionality to
spambayes-dev@python.org.  To get general help with SpamBayes, send your
questions to spambayes@python.org.

This sounds very useful.  Is the SVK paradigm changing so that online
use is assumed, and offline is a mode to switch to temporarily?  I'm
used to thinking of SVK in one two ways:

    1. As a better SVN client for normal always-online use
    2. As a full-time disconnected client, with rare online use
       to merge back to the SVN master

Is this new branch mode intended to generalize and replace the above
two?  Or is it a third use case entirely?

My biggest request (which you may or may not have any influence over) is
better distro packaging.  Both Debian and rpmforge have gone through
periods where SVK was completely fubar.  In fact, earlier this year
Debian screwed up their SVK package to the point of ""helpfully""
uninstalling it and making it impossible to reinstall.  And when the
replacement finally came, after a very long wait, it crashed all over
the place.  I avoided data loss by the skin of my teeth.  That whole
situation is what made me try git-svn -- I didn't have another decent
choice for disconnected Parrot work.

Anyway, applying some resources here and there to help the distro
packagers may have a big positive effect on the SVK user base.

Not trying to be an a--hole, but if you're using SLES you should be using 
Novell support.  If you're not paying for support with SLES, then you would 
probably be better off using something different.

This ML is specific to openSUSE, though having said that I must admit I'm not 
sure of what you're problem could be, so I am intrigued.

Could be someone else will post a suggestion, but really, this isn't really 
the proper forum for support.

And this after I pointed out the same problem with another directory

Unless Mark beats me to it, I should be able to do this in a day or  
two (assuming the changes he made to py2exe removing the requirement  
for Outlook 2000 work!).

I'll also check the .zip file at the same time, but I'm pretty sure  
we never had a problem with ones that Anthony did, so it should be fine.

I have figured out that I can shut down external usb drives with

  sg_start /dev/sgX -s 0

But how do I find out which device a specific path belongs to?  For
example, how can I find out that (currently) I need to shut down
/dev/sg3 if I want to shut down the disk that is on /media/some-disk?

Any hints?

           Summary: Giving plugins access to old X-Spam headers
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: 3.2.4
          Platform: All
        OS/Version: All

        ReportedBy: fkouwx@skenbe.net


In current versions of SpamAssassin spamd/spamassassin removes X-Spam headers
before giving access to the message to plugins. This is usually a good thing,
but when you want to revoke or report a false positive, having saved a signature
or something else in the X-Spam headers, there is no way to get that information
back.

Would it be possible to present the message in its prestine format, and leave it
up to the plugins to discard or not discard the old headers?

I think the key question is - what functionality does it provide that
you really, really need?  If it provides something really useful,
no-one will have a problem with it using up a small chunk of their
500Gb home-partition :-)

We have the fax-service (from Hylafax) setup as a faxprinter.  It makes
it very easy to send a fax directly from openoffice for instance. 
(which is what I typically do).

  I no longer have the archive kicking around my system, but I can
compress and send you the directory that I un-archived it into.  I
copied this over to /opt/jhylafax. I altered the script to run it from
there and placed it in my /home//bin directory.

But...if it still remained in memory when the time came for Beagle to

And for the ""green crowd"", since you are clocking ALL the ram chips to
keep memory alive...why waste that tiny bit of energy to save ram with

Perhaps I misunderstood, but I thought Tom was saying that if memory was 
not holding useful data the RAM cells that make up that unused memory 
need not be refreshed, thus saving some power (though it seems that it 
wouldn't be much). I think this would be problematic to implement, 
since it would be constrained by (or constrain) the organization of the 
chips on the DIMMs and of the row / column layout within the individual 
RAM chips. The extra complexity of kernel software and mainboard 
circuitry this entails combined with the very modest savings available 
all suggest to me an impractical idea.

I've never seen that, but I never leave KMail running after the end of a 
work day. And I don't usually leave it running when I'm away from the 
office, so that may be enough to prevent me from seeing these symptoms. 
Also, I make zero use of IMAP.

But from time to time (not often) KMail up an dies on me. Usually the 
KDE crash manager kicks in, but I think I recall cases where KMail 
simply vanishes. These crashes seem to be at least somewhat correlated 
with using the Find Messages... command.

KMail must manage its mailbox and index files pretty well, though, 
because I've never had any corruption following such crashes.

The SpamBayes tokenizer essentially splits the message at word boundaries,
so the two urls are considered separately.  Their physical and structural
proximity is not noted.  Synthetic tokens based on hostname or IP address in
the urls will be generated if you add x-pick_apart_urls:True to the
Tokenizer section of your config file.  For completeness here is my current
set of tokenizer settings (haven't changed them in a long while):

    [Tokenizer]
    record_header_absence:True

    mine_received_headers:True

Yeah, I know that's the default behavior.

That doesn't sound like it's doing what I'm asking about.  I want a
special token that is generated each time a link's text is just a URL
and the link and the URL text don't point to the same place.  Messages
with this property are always spam and account for a large percentage
of my unsures.  No matter how much I train on them, they keep falling
into unsure, so I thought if Spambayes could actually recognize their
distinguishing feature I could easily train it to consider them spam.

>From what you say above it looks like pick_apart_urls will generate
tokens describing different parts of a given URL, but will do nothing
to help capture this particular spammy relationship between enclosed
text and actual link.

Or did I misunderstand you?

Simply ""someaccount"" (without @localhost.blabla or just with @localhost)
should be ok, according to the virtual(5) manpage:

RESULT ADDRESS REWRITING
       The lookup result is subject to address rewriting:

       o      When the result  has  the  form  @otherdomain,  the
              result  becomes the same user in otherdomain.  This
              works only for the first address in a multi-address
              lookup result.

       o      When  ""append_at_myorigin=yes"", append ""@$myorigin""
              to addresses without ""@domain"".

       o      When ""append_dot_mydomain=yes"", 

(both append_* settings are ""yes"" by default"")

You have the Packman repository added, right? Then its not vanilla openSUSE.

You can deinstall amarok-yauap as workaround.

Hi Marcus and list,
- no I don't have packman...these are my repos:

http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/10.3/repo/non-oss/
http://download.opensuse.org/update/10.3/
dir:///opt/DVD (copy of org DVD)
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/10.3/standard/
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUESE:10.3/standard/

- mind you,  I don't understand the last two..which should I keep?
- I didn't do ANYTHING apart from adding the DVD repo and removing the 
original DVD location.

As always, your (and all others) help is greatly appreciated.

OT: I did a fresh install from 10.2 to 10.3, keeping my /home dir (and nothing 
more). All went flawlessly well, kodoos to all at SuSE's!! I'm on a DELL 
precision M90 (2GRam,  Centrino Duo, Nvidia).

Hello:

I have configured efax-gtk recently. It works well so far.
You can find here a guide how to install it (2nd post):

http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/susenovell-60/
problem-faxing-from-suse-10.2-
533654/?highlight=Problem+Faxing+from+SuSE+10.2

It is for 10.2 but works on 10.3 too.

Hope it helps.

This is only the case if gzip's stdout is a terminal (as it says). If
gzip is writing to a pipe (as it is in the srand docs) it is perfectly
happy, at least on my system:

    ~% ps axww | gzip | cat
    # gzip output

Hmm, this definitely needs further debugging, and solver testcases or logfiles,

That's what the whole IE-bundling lawsuit was about.

Microsoft's argument was that they indeed do *ON PURPOSE*
AS PART OF THEIR BUSINESS PLAN embed the IE code in the kernel.

When some CS prof demonstrated an IE-less Windows system,
MS almost immediately issued an SP bolting IE in so tightly
that there would be no repeat performances.

Microsoft's testimony in court.
The couldn't remove IE because it's WITHIN the kernel.

Since when has MS had the user's interest in mind when
locking them in to using MS products (therefore advancing
sales of their ""server"" software against competitors)
and spying on users (such as what web sites they are
visiting) is  profitable for them.

I noticed that there is a broken link in the footer, though. The
Info/Unsubscribe text links directly to the unsubscribe page, but it
uses a list name of ""spambayesInfo"" instead of ""spambayes"" and results
in a list not found error from the mailman server.

Did they ever disclose the source code that showed IE code in the 
kernel? If not, why do you believe them when they say it's in the 
kernel (_if_ they said that)?

Making the system inoperable without IE is still far from putting IE in 
the kernel. There are many ways to do the former.


By the way, where can I buy some of these software bolts? I've got some 
code that keeps coming loose 'cause all I can find is software glue, 
and apparently it's not impervious to bit rot.

It is implemented by an armed guard standing beside the computer :-P

Common, once someone has physical access to the computer, you depend on 
that person training and good will.

If that's an issue, dissable ctrl.alt.supr.

testing with mixed-effects models.
I would appreciate it if someone can clarify or correct this, or make
any further comments on the topic.

To test a single fixed effect:
1) Likelihood-ratio test (anova) using ML (not REML) is appropriate
but can be anti-conservative.
2) Monte Carlo methods (mcmcsamp) provide a better p-value estimate,
but this is not yet implemented for GLMM (e.g. binomial).

To test a single random effect:
1) Likelihood-ratio test (anova) is
a) appropriate without modification (Pinheiro & Bates 2000);
b) appropriate, but double the p-value (Spencer Bates, R-help);
c) appropriate, but halve the p-value (Agresti 2006, Lee Nelder & Pawitan 2006).
2) Monte Carlo methods, here too, can provide an accurate p-value estimate.

Thanks for your help,
Daniel

Thank you for attempting to donate the following domain(s):

hmail.madsods.gen.nz 

Unfortunately, it appears there are some problems with your
donation(s). Specifically, it appears the changes you made to your DNS
records are not correct or have changed. We have attempted to identify 
the problems for errant donation(s) below.

---------------------------------------

HMAIL.MADSODS.GEN.NZ
In order for this donation to be effective, you must point all the name
servers controlling HMAIL.MADSODS.GEN.NZ to our mail servers at
MX5.MXMAILER.COM. The specific problem we have identified with your DNS
modifications for this donation is that no MX record could be found 
for your donated MX Entry when we performed an MX query check. It could be that
we simply experienced a DNS error when we tested. However, you should check
to ensure that the MX (MADSODS.GEN.NZ) exists and can be dug: dig HMAIL.MADSODS.GEN.NZ MX
Windows users can perform a nslookup: nslookup set querytype=MX HMAIL.MADSODS.GEN.NZ


---------------------------------------

If you need to review detailed instructions on how to modify your DNS,
please visit the Manage MX Entries page on the Project Honey Pot
website and click on the MX Entries for which there are problems:

http://www.projecthoneypot.org/manage_mx_entries.php

Additional questions about donating an MX Entry may also be answered on
our FAQ:

http://www.projecthoneypot.org/faq.php#d

We will test your MX Entry donation(s) again over the next few days. If
a test succeeds, we will mark your donation(s) as active and notify you
via email. If the tests continue to fail, we will mark your errant
donation(s) as inactive. If subsequently you fix the problems, you may
reset a donation marked as inactive in order to begin testing again.

Your donations of MX Entries are critical in order for us to create
honey pot addresses in order to identify spammers. Thank you again for
contributing to Project Honey Pot.

Although the statement Preg[,k]<-coef(lm(tt~sel_col)) is applying lm() between the same vectors, the contents of one of the vectors (sel_col) should be changing with each cycle through the outer loop. My mistake is that I didn't specify information on the rows the data should go into. I have modified the statement to resemble something like this: pEUUreg[j:(j+1),k]<-coef(lm(tt~sel_col)), where j+1 ensures a jump of 2 rows, as slope and intercept are arranged vertically in the o/p matrix. I tried it on a section of one column (to save time) and it seemed to o/p some (varying) data to Preg. I now want to just extract the slope data into a new matrix, so I have added a statement for this. I was just wondering if there is a neater way to tell the lm() function to o/p slope data only? Perhaps one way would be to use [j,k] vs [j:(j+1),k) in the regression statement - forcing successive slope data to overwrite cell locations containing intercept data. Also, the full code takes an awfully long time to run. Would anyone be able to suggest a way for mee to speed it up - perhaps in the regression algorithm?

well... What Microsoft said is that the OS is tightly linked to IE, so 
they can't remove IE :-)

and I've seen a *mouse* driver requiring IE as dependency... (I beg it

discussion on the lack of security of windows is endless. and vista is 
funny on this respect. every single operation need to be acnowledged 
twice by the user, so nobody read the popup anymore, it could be ""your

I use gmail as well, though I get the mail delivered via POP and only rarely
use the gmail web interface.  I just went back and looked at this and a
couple other threads via the gmail web interface.  Not only did I not see or
click URLs with missing ""/"" characters, I did not encounter any
Info/Unsubscribe links which ended in ""/Unsubscribe"".  They all took me
(correctly, I believe) to the "".../listinfo/spambayes"" page.  Maybe it's a
browser problem or an interaction between gmail and your web browser.  I'm
viewing through Thunderbird 2.0.0.something on Solaris 10 at the moment.  I
can check using Safari and T-Bird from my Mac when I get home.

I used to think it made using the kde-help system more useful, but then 
it just kept listing the same help files over and over and not providing

You're talking about the binary, right?  After all, lots of software can
be built for all kinds of OS'es which would mean they're not really
tied to the OS, but once you've only got the binary, then yes, you're
tied to an OS that has the right kind of loader etc. etc.

I wouldn't even think of buying real estate in the Bay Area.  I'm 
renting, plain and simple.  I'd prefer a house, but my few days in the 
Spring didn't find anything reasonable to rent.

As for the area as a source of work, education (in various senses), 
opportunity, venture capital, etc., it remains the magical kingdom.  Say 
it ain't so...
Salaries are probably still depressed, the commute can be a killer, 
etc., but in my situation I'll be immune to most of those problems 
barring a disaster of some kind.

Been there, done that, have the suit and tie (well, I usually avoid 
that)...  There are definitely great things about the DC area.  It 
remains my second favorite all around place to be.
On the other hand, too much work here is semi-mundane application of 
technology invented elsewhere and frequently there is a distaste for 
innovation.

I will always write code, although I have been working my way out of a 
cold period, brought on by too many architecture-level projects.  
Loosing coding skills is definitely something to avoid.  Any Ph.D. work 
I do will involve a lot of code.

Yes, and there's a guy leading the Econ department who used to do AI, 
among other things.  I could get into that somewhat, although I'm not 
quite ready for full immersion in Econ.  If I wanted to end up on Wall 
Street and make money that way, which has some interesting 
possibilities, that might make sense.  It's not an immediate choice however.
> (Understand all this educational advice is from a guy that didn't have

;-)  I'm mostly self-taught, except for the Masters work, so there you 
go.  I caught the bug at IJCAI/AAAI/IAAI 2003 and have the momentum from 
the Masters, but I know that it is of dubious worth in the average 
case.  I'm not average and, as you concur, AI at Stanford/MIT/CMU is a 
whole different thing.  I see a boom / bubble coming, probably in two 
waves, and since I cannot at the moment stomach a raw startup, this is a 
different path into that space.

It appears that being a student at Stanford will be enough to get member 
access to W3C and I can get there by taking a NDP class (Non-degree 
program), I think.

I did Haskell...  It would take a lot, a super-Eclipse or something, for

The right answer will be simple, fun, clear, semantically scalable, and 
powerful.  We're not there yet.  A lot of crap results from 
pseudo-solutions like the old requirement at NCR that Pascal functions 
not be more than 10 lines of code.  Try finding all of that 
""non-complex"" complexity spread over thousands of functions, files, and 
modules and class hierarchies 20 deep.  Blech.

At the heart of any organization is the data center. Unfortunately,
as data centers grow in complexity, scale and importance, their
efficiency has been severely hindered by a growing avalanche of data.
With no end in sight for this growing data, the need to remove data
center bottlenecks has reached a critical state.

This white paper looks at the critical components of today's data
center and the common bottlenecks involved. Learn how shifting to
clustered storage architectures can help solve these problems and
help organizations realize the true potential of the next generation
data center.

http://go.techtarget.com/r/3044491/2079970

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ABOUT THIS FEATURED WHITE PAPER SPONSORED BY: Isilon Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are three core elements to today's data center - compute power,
the network and storage. Of the three, storage has lagged behind in
advancements and has created bottlenecks, stalling the full
maturation of the centralized data center to its next and necessary
evolutionary state.

Read this white paper to learn how an ongoing shift towards clustered
storage architectures may help to drive storage forward and, perhaps,
even enable it to leap-frog the other data center components in speed
and performance. Discover the benefits of clustered storage
architectures, including:

** Inherent high availability and reliability
** Allows for a single level of management
** Linear scalability in performance and capacity
** Enterprise ready

Untitled Document











 Spending on Rich Internet Applications is going to exceed $500M by 2011 !

“It's really time for US enterprises to start switching to the Web as a platform for application delivery. They have stayed in the client-server world for too long, compared to the rapid adoption of Web 2.0 in the consumer space. The easiest way for stepping up to Web 2.0 (Web as a platform) is through the door called RIA.”




								  - BERT HALSTEAD
								  Chief Architect, Curl

For today's (and tomorrow's) applications that run via the Web, should they be AJAX-based - or do AIR/Flash/Flex, JavaFX, or Silverlight offer better results? And what about Appcelerator, OpenLaszlo, or Curl, or any of the other many open source alternatives that have emerged? 

To inspire you to come to AJAXWorld 2008 East and choose your direction for Rich Internet Applications, we bring you here the entire Conference Program, from which you can see that there are sessions covering just about ever RIA technology currently available, whether your interest is AIR 1.0, Flex 2 and 3, Curl 5.0, Open Laszlo 4.0, Silverlight 2.0, Rico 2.0, Zend Framework 1.5, Grails 1.0, Groovy 1.5 - you name it, we have speakers who are knowledgeable about it and giving a session or part of a session about it.


 


Come see why, as a recent ZapThink report predicted,  spending on RIAs is going to exceed $500 million dollars by 2011. No company developing web applications can afford to wait any longer to solidify their Rich Internet Application strategy: 2008 is the Decision Year for RIAs.

				
2008 is the year that US enterprises are switching in increasing numbers to the Web as a platform for application delivery, and 2008 too will for many enterprises be the Decision Year for their choice of RIA platform. Make that choice in New York City in March! AJAXWorld Conference & Expo is the place to be if you want easy access under one roof to a welter of resources, ideas and examples to help you decide.


The extensive Expo floor additionally will allow you to follow up on the premier solutions already available and to choose which best suits your needs. In short, AJAXWorld is where you can discover everything you're going to need for business survival and Web success in 2008. 								
								




Hope to see you in New York City at the 6th International AJAXWorld !

David,

Can you explain how the pickle would be read and written simultaneously?
Are we talking multiple apps or the same app from multiple threads?
(Haven't looked at your patch yet...)

I assume it's the same app from multiple processes.  I don't know how
my server hands messages off to procmail -- it could well be running
them in parallel.  And then there's my cron job that does training
once daily, which could happen at the same time as any message
arrives.

That would be it.  There is no locking of the various databases between
processes.  I suppose we could implement something, but the vagaries of
network file systems and cross-platform demands have always made that task
problematic.  Maybe we should expand your safe_pickle code into
safe_pickle_read and safe_pickle_write with a corresponding bit of file
locking code they can invoke (which will probably be ugly as sin - but
hidden away in a dark corner - once it's complete).

Well, do you have the latest version of SA, or the latest ruleset that 
sa-update can provide you?

Looking at your message headers, it appears your version of SA is old 
(3.1.4), and sa-update cannot update the spamassassin code, only rulesets.

You might want to consider upgrading. There's 9 releases ahead of that, 
and we're now on 3.2.4.

If you're having problems, I'd recommend you start by installing a 
current version of SpamAssassin.

 From there, we can look at your rule hits and see if something else is 
also problematic, like mistrained bayes, bad trust path, etc. However, 
we'd need the list of rules some of  your low scoring spam is matching 
to even begin to look for those problems.

Any interest in maybe having a SpamBayes sprint at PyCon in Chicago next
March?  Many readers of the ttrbkgvhb@python.org mailing list probably won't
have any idea what I'm referring to, so a brief explanation is in order.
The open source world tends to be highly distributed.  Two of the primary
SpamBayes developera are in Australia.  Others are in the US.  A sprint is a
place where a number of people get together to work on an open source
project together.

So, if we can get enough Python/SpamBayes programmers together at PyCon we
might think about having a sprint.

The reason for short sessions is that the Secretariat can assign 
adjacent slots to the same WG to create a long one if that is what is needed.

Untitled Document











 Spending on Rich Internet Applications is going to exceed $500M by 2011 !

“It's really time for US enterprises to start switching to the Web as a platform for application delivery. They have stayed in the client-server world for too long, compared to the rapid adoption of Web 2.0 in the consumer space. The easiest way for stepping up to Web 2.0 (Web as a platform) is through the door called RIA.”




								  - BERT HALSTEAD
								  Chief Architect, Curl

For today's (and tomorrow's) applications that run via the Web, should they be AJAX-based - or do AIR/Flash/Flex, JavaFX, or Silverlight offer better results? And what about Appcelerator, OpenLaszlo, or Curl, or any of the other many open source alternatives that have emerged? 

To inspire you to come to AJAXWorld 2008 East and choose your direction for Rich Internet Applications, we bring you here the entire Conference Program, from which you can see that there are sessions covering just about ever RIA technology currently available, whether your interest is AIR 1.0, Flex 2 and 3, Curl 5.0, Open Laszlo 4.0, Silverlight 2.0, Rico 2.0, Zend Framework 1.5, Grails 1.0, Groovy 1.5 - you name it, we have speakers who are knowledgeable about it and giving a session or part of a session about it.


 


Come see why, as a recent ZapThink report predicted,  spending on RIAs is going to exceed $500 million dollars by 2011. No company developing web applications can afford to wait any longer to solidify their Rich Internet Application strategy: 2008 is the Decision Year for RIAs.

				
2008 is the year that US enterprises are switching in increasing numbers to the Web as a platform for application delivery, and 2008 too will for many enterprises be the Decision Year for their choice of RIA platform. Make that choice in New York City in March! AJAXWorld Conference & Expo is the place to be if you want easy access under one roof to a welter of resources, ideas and examples to help you decide.


The extensive Expo floor additionally will allow you to follow up on the premier solutions already available and to choose which best suits your needs. In short, AJAXWorld is where you can discover everything you're going to need for business survival and Web success in 2008. 								
								




Hope to see you in New York City at the 6th International AJAXWorld !

It's been a busy few months for us, for sure.  I know we always say
that, but lately it's been particularly true!  We have a lot to
announce, so let's get started.

Last month we launched our SourceForge.net Marketplace, where developers
can turn their expertise in to a business and consumers can find an
unprecedented level of support.  There were naturally a few bumps along
the way, but, all told, the launch went extremely well!  We'd like to
express our deepest gratitude to the beta program participants, who
allowed us to launch this service in a more informed, confident manner.

If you have any feedback on these new services, please use our
Marketplace Discussion forum:

http://sourceforge.net/community/forum/forum.php?id=10

While we were at it, we also released our newly redesigned Project
Registration system.  It is our hope that this new system will allow
people to create projects more quickly and easily while still providing
the information we need to ensure their legitimacy.  So if you've been
sitting on a cool project idea because you were waiting for an easier
way to register, now's the time!

This month, we performed a major update to the infrastructure of our
project network and have already begun seeing vastly improved service
times.  We also launched a modernization of our user registration
process, designed to make what should be an easy process a whole lot
easier.  And, as if all that weren't enough, we launched the new Jobs
section where you can find that employment opportunity you've secretly
been looking for.  We won't tell your current employer, promise.

Now to a bit of housekeeping.  We added several new software categories
based on requests from our community, and we think it's a good idea for
all project admins to familiarize themselves with them.  Among them are
categories for Jabber, JSON, RSS readers, AJAX, and the Ingres database.

We hope that these new categories will help users find the software
they're looking for.  For a full list, go to:

Thanks for reading!

See you next time,
The SourceForge.net Team

replies that look like this: ""Hey! I didn't ask to be on this list! You
spammer. I hate you! I hate your dog! (insert other colorful phrases

check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low volume."" You left it

    Webcast & Podcast Alert


























ON-DEMAND WEBCAST 









Although virtualization frees any single virtual machine from dependence on a single physical server, often a single server will support five, 10, or even 20 or more virtual machines. In a virtualized environment, a single hardware failure can threaten many applications running on different virtual machines.

This webcast and podcast looks at virtualization beyond its consolidation and cost reduction benefits, to the importance of high availability and business continuity in virtual environments. Topics covered include:

High availability features of VMware ESX
Continuous availability needs of mission-critical Linux applications
How to achieve business continuity by combining ESX capabilities with fault-tolerant ftServer Systems

Introduction to Imprecise Probabilities*"" will be held at the Wyndham
Hotel & Resort in Palm Springs, California, on Sunday, 5 December 2004. 

The workshop review the limitations of Monte Carlo methods and
describe strategies to escape these limitations.  It will introduce
the notions of interval- valued probability and imprecisely specified
probability distributions and review their uses in risk analysis. It
will introduce the approaches of interval probabilities, probability
bounds analysis, Dempster-Shafer theory, robust Bayes methods,
info-gap theory, and the theory of imprecise probabilities.  It will
also illustrate how sparse, incomplete or imprecise data can be used
to fashion inputs without making strong or untenable assumptions.

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the Society for Risk Analysis
Annual Meeting, but you don't have to register for the annual meeting to
participate in the workshop.  The registration fee for the workshop is $175
before 10 November, or $205 after this date, or on site.

Might make sense to add at least one BSD box to the mix, generally when 1
BSD build works it should be quite similar on the rest. The above is a bit
heavy on the Linux (glibc) side and will not really expose problems on that
front aside from the commercial Solaris and OS X.

I don't understand how applink is going to help you. The SSL libs are
statically linked into the _ssl extension DLL.

It seems it's just trying to be clever. The examples you gave were of 
applications that were swapped out, so ps doesn't have access to the 
real command line and instead prints only the program's base name as 
recorded in the process table. This is signified by enclosing that name 
in square brackets. The cleverness, such as it is, then, is not 
discarding the trailing square bracket and truncating the string inside 
the square brackets.

And as ever, when run through a pipe, a default width must be used, 
since the output is not going (directly) to a terminal.

David, I would give it a go.  I've done more than my share of BIOS
updates over the last 15 years, and I've only once had one go wrong.  I
even managed to recover from that one.  The Gigabyte flash process is
actually pretty straight forward - I've already been through it twice.

Last update on the situation with my board - I'm returning it for
replacement.  Last from Gigabyte support was:

I don't know where he got the idea that it might a temperature dependent
issue. He hasn't asked for temperature measurements.  

I'm quite tempted to move the system outside tomorrow - in the early
morning we're a couple of degrees below - with a huge external fan, I
should be able to keep the whole thing _very_ cold.  Mind you, I will
be disappointed if it then starts to work.  The amount of cooling I've
got should be enough.

Haha, that's always the issue when you buy the components and assemble
them yourself isn't it?  The shop I bought from even offers
an ""assemble it for you"" service, but when it comes to RMA time, that
would only mean more costs (in sending the whole thing back instead of
just the motherboard). 

Anyway, I _really_ appreciate everyone pitching in here.  Even when it
is so OT as it really is.

Out of curiousity, can you replicate command?

$ perl -MO=Deparse -e 'print join("":"", split(/ */, ""hi there""));'
print join(':', split(/ */, 'hi there', 0));
-e syntax OK

I'm just trying to confirm that there isn't some weird shell interaction (yes, I

1. New Sessions Announced for Atlanta Meeting
------------------------------------------------------

     HOTEL DEADLINE EXTENDED: RESERVE THIS WEEK

If you work in the field of HR services and technology, then
attend HR-XML's spring technical meeting to learn about and
influence the future of HR services standards.
http://www.hr-xml.org/meetings/atlanta

The HR-XML Consortium's spring technical meeting is being held
2008 March 3-4, at the Marriott Atlanta Midtown Suites,
Atlanta, GA, US.

Come to Atlanta for an in-depth briefing on HR-XML 3.0, a look
at the mechanics of applying OAGIS Business Object Documents
technologies to HR, and workgroup sessions covering recruiting
and staffing, benefits enrollment, employment screening,
assessments and performance management, and more. See session
highlights below and the full agenda at:
http://www.hr-xml.org/meetings/atlanta

----------------------------
* Getting Started with the Core Components, Mark Crawford, SAP.
----------------------------
The core component technical specification (CCTS) provides a
syntax-neutral methodology for creating data constructs with
the aim of maximizing re-use and interoperability across multiple
business domains. Increasingly, CCTS and the conforming core component
library (CCL) maintained by the United Nations Centre for Trade
Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) are the basis for
business data standards development across industries and business
domains. In this session, Mark Crawford, Standards Architect, SAP,
will provide an overview of CCTS, the UN/CEFACT Core Component Library
(CCL), and the implications and opportunities for the HR-XML Consortium.

----------------------------
* Ontologies, Competencies, and HR-XML, Luk Vervenne, Synergetics.
----------------------------
Luk Vervenne is an Internet entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Synergetics,
an Antwerp, Belgium-based research company that is an innovator in
the field of competency-driven human capital processes. Luk is newly
appointed to HR-XML's board of directors and was a founder of
HR-XML Consortium Europe. In this session, Luk will review Synergetic's
current work and priorities, which include supporting EU-sponsored
employability initiatives through the development a series of
competencies ontologies. Luk will review work of special interest to the
HR-XML community, including:
    * Development of a competency ontology, an ontology for
      competency content, and one for competency context;
    * A competency profile management framework; and
    * Issues surrounding, and approaches to support, the use of
      ontology-based modeling approaches to enhance and enrich
      HR-XML's XML-based business language standards.

----------------------------
* A BOD is a Powerful Thing: A Look at the Mechanics of Using BODs,
Michael Rowell, Oracle and Steffen Fohn, ADP.
----------------------------

HR-XML 3.0 leverages the Open Application Group's Business Object Document
(BOD) architecture. A BOD brings together a verb and a noun. For example,
""ProcessTimecard."" In a sense, the BOD architecture provides the best of
both worlds -- course-grain verbs useful for working with arms-length
trading partners and features such as action codes and expressions with
which to perform fine-grain operations. This session will examine how
implementers can combine verb, noun, action code, and expression to
address some of the vexing challenges encountered in integrating HR data
across systems.
